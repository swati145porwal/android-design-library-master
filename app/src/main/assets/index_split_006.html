<h3 class="sigilNotInTOC">Conked Out! </h3>

<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">FOR several moments after Mr. Kampura’s shocking announcement about Mrs. Rossmeyer, </p>
<p class="calibre2">there was silence. Nancy and her father looked at each other, then at the Mises. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Finally Mr. Drew asked, “Are you sure of your information? We heard nothing about this in </p>
<p class="calibre2">our country.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr. Kampura rose from his chair and said, “I have no details. Her death was discussed at a </p>
<p class="calibre2">jeweler’s conference. As you know, she was a lover of gems and, therefore, was well known </p>
<p class="calibre2">to the trade.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“In a company as large and successful as yours,” Mr. Drew said, “I suppose you have a good </p>
<p class="calibre2">deal of thievery.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh,  no,  not  at  all,”  Mr.  Kampura  replied.  “We  have  very  tight  security  and  little  loss.” </p>
<p class="calibre2">Impatiently, he stepped from behind his desk and went toward the door. The Drews and the </p>
<p class="calibre2">Mises realized that he did not wish to prolong the meeting, and they followed him. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m from a rather small town in the United States,” Mr. Drew said. “However, a Japanese </p>
<p class="calibre2">man lives there who is an expert on gems. His name is Moto. Do you know him?” </p>
<p class="calibre2">26 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“No,” Mr. Kampura replied, “I have never heard of him.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He opened the door, and the visitors thanked him, said good-by, and left. No remarks were </p>
<p class="calibre2">exchanged as they went down in the elevator and out the building. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">When they were seated once more in the Mises car, Mrs. Mise spoke up. “Nancy, I am sure </p>
<p class="calibre2">that Mr. Kampura did not discover your disguise. I am very glad.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“So  am  I,”  Nancy  remarked.  “I  have  a  hunch  that  Mr.  Kampura  was  not  telling  the  truth </p>
<p class="calibre2">about  either  Mrs.  Rossmeyer  or  Mr.  Moto.  Let’s  try  to  find  out  about  Mrs.  Rossmeyer </p>
<p class="calibre2">through other sources.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr. Mise directed them to a Tokyo newspaper office that published an English edition. They </p>
<p class="calibre2">looked  through file  copies  for any notices of  the  socialite’s death.  There  was nothing,  and </p>
<p class="calibre2">the group drove home. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr.  Drew  made  various  overseas  telephone  calls  but  could  not  verify  the  report  that  Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Kampura had given them. Finally Nancy had an idea. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Dad, you remember Renee Marcel who attended school with me? She was from Paris and </p>
<p class="calibre2">now is a society reporter for a paper there. Why don’t I get in touch with her? Surely if Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Rossmeyer died, Renee would know about it.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Good thinking. Phone Renee and see what she can find out.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy put in the call and surprised her friend. The two girls chatted about personal matters </p>
<p class="calibre2">for a few moments, then Nancy asked about Mrs. Rossmeyer. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hold the line,” Renee answered. “I will make a quick search.” She was gone no more than </p>
<p class="calibre2">two  minutes.  “Nancy,”  she  said  upon  her  return,  “this  story  is  not  true.  Night  before  last, </p>
<p class="calibre2">Mrs. Rossmeyer gave a large dinner party in Paris. I’ll try to get in touch with her and let you </p>
<p class="calibre2">know more details if I can.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy  gave  Renee  the  Mises’  telephone  number  and  waited  for  an  answer.  It  came  after </p>
<p class="calibre2">lunch. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I learned that Mrs. Rossmeyer is in good health,” Renee reported. “She told a friend that </p>
<p class="calibre2">for personal reasons she was going into hiding for a short time.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Have you any idea where?” Nancy asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Renee said that one source had mentioned Japan, another the United States. Later that day, </p>
<p class="calibre2">the  girl  phoned  again.  She  had  spoken  to  the  porter  in  Mrs.  Rossmeyer’s  hotel.  He  had </p>
<p class="calibre2">heard her say the previous day that she was heading for the airport to fly to Japan to the </p>
<p class="calibre2">Mikomoto Pearl Farm. It was her expectation to make some large purchases. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">27 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy  was  elated  about  the  news.  “Could  we  go  there  soon  and  verify  the  report?”  she </p>
<p class="calibre2">asked Mr. Mise. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“It is a long way from here,” he said. “But a friend of mine runs a seaplane that he charters </p>
<p class="calibre2">to groups. Let me call him and see when the next flight is.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After a short phone conversation, their host hung up with a smile. “The plane is leaving for </p>
<p class="calibre2">the pearl farm early tomorrow morning.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Wonderful!” Nancy exclaimed. “We’re in luck!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Conversation now turned from Mrs. Rossmeyer to Mr. Kampura. Had he lied intentionally to </p>
<p class="calibre2">throw  the  Drews  off  the  scent?  Was  Mrs.  Rossmeyer  in  some  way  connected  with  World </p>
<p class="calibre2">Wide Gems? Was he trying to protect her? And why had he denied knowing Mr. Moto? Had </p>
<p class="calibre2">they not been his tire tracks that showed the Rising Sun insignia in the rear of the jewelry </p>
<p class="calibre2">shop? </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy mentioned that she felt it was probably wise to contact the police at this point. “They </p>
<p class="calibre2">may have records on World Wide Gems, Mr. Kampura, and Mrs. Rossmeyer.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr. Mise said he would take Nancy to headquarters but suggested that perhaps she would </p>
<p class="calibre2">like to remove her Japanese disguise. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’ll be happy to,” Nancy said. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It  took  her  nearly  half  an  hour  to  restore  her  skin  to  the  American  look,  to  lighten  the </p>
<p class="calibre2">blackened eyebrows, and to change into her own clothes. Then she and Mr. Mise set off. He </p>
<p class="calibre2">knew the chief of police personally and explained their case, translating for Nancy what he </p>
<p class="calibre2">learned. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“It is not generally known, but World Wide Gems is under surveillance in several countries,” </p>
<p class="calibre2">the chief told them. “As you heard in the United States, the organization as a whole is not </p>
<p class="calibre2">suspected of  any  wrongdoing,  but  certain  members  are thought to  have  connections  with </p>
<p class="calibre2">underworld characters. The police are watching carefully.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Is Mr. Kampura under suspicion?” Nancy asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Not so far. Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Because we think that he visited Mr. Moto’s jewelry shop in River Heights just before the </p>
<p class="calibre2">jeweler disappeared without a trace. But Mr. Kampura denied knowing Mr. Moto. He also </p>
<p class="calibre2">told us Mrs. Rossmeyer had a fatal accident, which does not seem to be true.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The chief nodded thoughtfully. “We will try to find out more about Mr. Kampura.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy  asked  the  chief  about  Mr.  Moto,  but  as  far  as  he  knew,  the  man  had  not  come  to </p>
<p class="calibre2">Japan. </p>
<p class="calibre2">28 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m afraid he was kidnapped,” Nancy said. “It seems strange that Mr. Kikichi, whom he left </p>
<p class="calibre2">in charge of his shop, had not heard anything from his friend after he left.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“It is possible,” the officer said, “that Mr. Moto, for some reason of his own, disappeared in </p>
<p class="calibre2">a hurry, and therefore left his room in a shambles. Has anyone investigated the possibility </p>
<p class="calibre2">that he might have gone into hiding?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy admitted that they had not thought of this. “But why should he?” she asked. “He has </p>
<p class="calibre2">had the shop in River Heights for many years and is highly respected.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Even  the  finest  people  can  have  enemies,”  the  officer  said  with  a  smile.  “They  might  be </p>
<p class="calibre2">connected with business, or family, or even friends.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“But Mr. Moto is such a nice man. I can’t imagine his having any personal enemies. I’m sure </p>
<p class="calibre2">that if something happened to him, it was because of the thievery going on in his business.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The chief promised to let her know if any leads to Mr. Moto’s disappearance turned up, and </p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy and Mr. Mise thanked him, then left. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After  their  visit  to  police  headquarters,  there  was  still  enough  time  for  the  Drews  to  do </p>
<p class="calibre2">some shopping and to go to Mr. Tetsuo Moto’s former residence to see if they could learn a </p>
<p class="calibre2">clue from the neighbors. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr.  Mise  picked  up  Mr.  Drew,  who  had  visited  a  business  associate  during  his  daughter’s </p>
<p class="calibre2">trip to police headquarters, then he drove the Drews to the Ginza, Tokyo’s main shopping </p>
<p class="calibre2">street. Nancy’s first purchase was a lovely pearl necklace for Hannah Gruen. The salesman </p>
<p class="calibre2">showed them matching earrings and suggested that the lucky receiver of the necklace could </p>
<p class="calibre2">surely use earrings to go with it. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr. Drew smiled. “All right, we’ll take them for Hannah, too.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Pretty pins of pearls intertwined with enameled leaves were selected for Bess and George. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy’s  gift  to  Ned  Nickerson  was  a  pearl  stick  pin,  and  she  bought  cufflinks  for  Burt  and </p>
<p class="calibre2">Dave with money the girls had given her. The Drews concluded their shopping with a lovely </p>
<p class="calibre2">pearl and silver bracelet for Mr. Drew’s sister, Eloise. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">While  they  were  waiting  for  the  articles  to  be  gift-wrapped,  Nancy  wandered  around  the </p>
<p class="calibre2">store looking at pictures on the walls. Suddenly she stopped in front  of an oil painting of a </p>
<p class="calibre2">queen. She was wearing a necklace with a huge pinkish pearl in the middle and smaller-sized </p>
<p class="calibre2">white ones on both sides of it. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I  wonder  if  this  is  like  Mrs.  Rossmeyer’s,”  Nancy  thought  and  looked  at  the  date  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre2">picture. It was a hundred years old. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“This type of necklace must have been popular with royalty in those days,” the girl mused. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">29 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Just  then  Mr.  Mise  said  he  would  bring  the  car  to  the  door.  After  he  left,  the  Drews </p>
<p class="calibre2">examined various art objects that were displayed throughout the shop. They saw a vase that </p>
<p class="calibre2">was very similar to the one belonging to Professor Mise and his wife in River Heights, which </p>
<p class="calibre2">Togo had inadvertently broken. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Let’s  buy  it  and  have  it  sent  to  them!”  Nancy  urged  her  father.  He  agreed.  When  the </p>
<p class="calibre2">transaction was taken care of, they walked out of the shop and climbed into Mr. Mise’s car. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He  drove  them  to  the  street  where  Mr.  Moto’s  brother  had  lived.  They  found  the  small </p>
<p class="calibre2">apartment building facing one of the many streams that crisscrossed the city. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Suppose we question the neighbors first,” Nancy suggested. “I’ll go with Mrs. Mise and Dad </p>
<p class="calibre2">with Mr. Mise, so we each have a translator.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Good idea,” Mr. Drew agreed. “We’ll meet out here when we’re finished.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It was more than an hour before the four assembled in the street again. Their search had </p>
<p class="calibre2">been unsuccessful. A number of people had known Tetsuo Moto, but could tell the Drews </p>
<p class="calibre2">no more than that he had moved to the country. Next, the group went to all neighborhood </p>
<p class="calibre2">stores  and  questioned  the  owners,  but  again  in  vain.  There  was  no  trace  of  the  jeweler’s </p>
<p class="calibre2">brother! </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“We’ll just have to rely on the police to track him down,” Mr. Drew said to Nancy, who was </p>
<p class="calibre2">very disappointed. “I’ll call them again tonight.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">She nodded. “Even though I believe Mr. Moto was kidnapped, I was still hoping to pick up </p>
<p class="calibre2">some  information  from  his  brother,  Tetsuo.  Well—”  she  sighed,  “maybe  we’ll  find  a  clue </p>
<p class="calibre2">elsewhere.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Early the following morning the Mises and the Drews set out for a visit to a pearl farm. They </p>
<p class="calibre2">drove to the dock where the seaplane was anchored and joined a group of people for the </p>
<p class="calibre2">take-off. The journey was pleasant and the scenery interesting, with woods and mountains </p>
<p class="calibre2">in the background. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Tell me something about pearl farms,” Nancy begged Mr. Mise. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I will be glad to,” he said. “You see, there are two kinds of beds, those in which the oysters </p>
<p class="calibre2">are raised until they are large enough to be used in pearl culture, and those in which they </p>
<p class="calibre2">are kept after insertion of the nucleus.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Today we’ll see one of the latter kind, won’t we?” Nancy asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“That is right. They must be in an area where nutritious plankton is plentiful and where the </p>
<p class="calibre2">currents can flow freely around the oyster,” Mr. Mise went on, “but they shouldn’t be near </p>
<p class="calibre2">mouths of rivers that pump pollution into the sea.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Should the water be a certain temperature?” </p>
<p class="calibre2">30 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, yes. The oysters tolerate a range between fifty and seventy-seven degrees Fahrenheit. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Since the farm waters reach temperatures below fifty degrees in the winter, the rafts and </p>
<p class="calibre2">baskets must be moved farther south. To people in the culture region, these caravans that </p>
<p class="calibre2">are pulled by boats are a familiar sight.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy laughed. “I wonder if the oysters enjoy the trip.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I suppose we will never know,” Mr. Mise said with a chuckle. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“How about depth?” Nancy asked. “Does that influence the production of nacre?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Definitely. In shallow water, more layers develop, but they tend to be of inferior quality.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“What is considered shallow?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“About  seven  to  ten  feet.  You  see,  when  water  temperatures  are  between  fifty-nine  and </p>
<p class="calibre2">seventy-seven degrees in the summer, increased nacre production is encouraged. But in the </p>
<p class="calibre2">winter, the oysters are lowered to a depth of about seventeen to twenty feet. This insures a </p>
<p class="calibre2">lovely pink color and better quality.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“How old are the oysters when they are injected with the nucleus?” Nancy inquired. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“About two years.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After  a  long  flight,  the  pilot’s  voice  sounded  over  the  intercom.  He  announced  that  they </p>
<p class="calibre2">would be landing soon. He spoke first in English, then in Japanese. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly the seaplane began to lurch. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“What’s happening?” Nancy asked apprehensively, looking at her father. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I don’t know,” Mr. Drew replied. “I can’t imagine—” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The  craft  lurched  again,  and  the  smooth  hum  of  the  engines  seemed  to  change.  The </p>
<p class="calibre2">passengers  were  tossed  about,  and  a  woman  screamed.  An  engine  conked  out,  then  the </p>
<p class="calibre2">other. Nancy and her father grabbed each other’s hands. Were they about to crash? </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
