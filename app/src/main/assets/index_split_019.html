<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Thirteenth Pearl </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“THE newspaper office?” Ned asked, puzzled. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes,” Nancy replied. “I believe that the real Mrs. Rossmeyer is still in Europe and that the </p>
<p class="calibre2">one who was at the party is an impostor!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ned was amazed. “You mean she just borrowed the house?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes,” Nancy replied. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I didn’t realize that you had never seen a picture of Tanya Rossmeyer,” Ned commented. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Unfortunately I haven’t, but the Gazette must have plenty of them.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">When they arrived at the newspaper office, a young man at the front counter asked, “You </p>
<p class="calibre2">wish to place an ad? It’s too late for the morning paper. That has just been put to bed.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy and Ned looked puzzled, and he explained, “That means the forms have been locked </p>
<p class="calibre2">in place and the paper put on the press.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy spoke up. “We didn’t come about an ad. There may be a big story breaking for you </p>
<p class="calibre2">people. May I see some photographs of Mrs. Tanya Rossmeyer?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The young man, who said to call him Jim, went to an inner room to look through the files. A </p>
<p class="calibre2">few  minutes  later he  came  back  with  a folder  containing  several  photographs of the  well-</p>
<p class="calibre2">known socialite. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Here she is,” Jim said. “I hear the woman’s loaded.” He grinned. “That means she has a lot </p>
<p class="calibre2">of money.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy  ignored  his  facetiousness.  After  she  and  Ned  had  looked  at  three  different </p>
<p class="calibre2">photographs  of  the  striking  brunette  who  appeared  to  be  in  her  late  thirties,  they  were </p>
<p class="calibre2">convinced that the woman at the party had indeed been an impostor. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ned thanked Jim, and the young couple left. When they were outside, Ned remarked, “So </p>
<p class="calibre2">that ‘goddess’ was just a cheap fake!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes.” Suddenly Nancy thought of something else and turned back to the newspaper office. </p>
<p class="calibre2">“I wonder if there were any recent articles telling exactly where the real Mrs. Rossmeyer is,” </p>
<p class="calibre2">she said. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Jim was surprised to see them again. “Did you bring the big story you promised?” he asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy smiled. “Not yet. I’d like a little help first. Will you check recent papers to see if there </p>
<p class="calibre2">have been any recent articles about Mrs. Rossmeyer?” </p>
<p class="calibre2">78 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Jim went off and came back with a copy of the morning paper. “Maybe there’s something in </p>
<p class="calibre2">here,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy and Ned turned the pages and ran their fingers down the various columns. Suddenly </p>
<p class="calibre2">Ned stopped. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Look at this!” he said, and he began to read aloud:Mrs. Tanya Rossmeyer of River Heights is </p>
<p class="calibre2">giving a dinner party on Tuesday for Count and Countess Sorrentino. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy interrupted. “Tuesday! That’s today! Where is the item from?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Paris,” Ned replied. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“That settles it. Mrs. Rossmeyer is in Paris and not in River Heights.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Is that the big story?” Jim asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Once more Nancy smiled enigmatically. “No. But I believe you will have it very soon.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Before  the  young  man  could  ask  further  questions,  Nancy  and  Ned  raced  from  the </p>
<p class="calibre2">newspaper office. Their next stop was police headquarters. They burst inside and told the </p>
<p class="calibre2">officer  on  duty that  a  fake  Mrs.  Rossmeyer  had  “borrowed”  the  socialite’s  home  and  was </p>
<p class="calibre2">having a big and very strange party there. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“What!” the officer said. “I’ll get some men with squad cars to investigate at once.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy suggested that the policeman follow her and Ned. “We’ve just come from the estate </p>
<p class="calibre2">and know exactly where it is,” she added. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">While the men were assembling, Nancy told the officer that she suspected the group who </p>
<p class="calibre2">was  at  the  estate  were  jewel  thieves.  “They’ve  probably  robbed  Mrs.  Rossmeyer’s  house. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Would you get in touch with my father and Chief McGinnis? I’m sure they’ll want to come </p>
<p class="calibre2">along.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">When the young sleuth and her companion reached the Rossmeyer mansion, they found to </p>
<p class="calibre2">their dismay that it was in darkness. The last car of guests was just pulling away. It was not </p>
<p class="calibre2">coming toward them, but going out a back service road. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Let’s follow it!” Nancy urged Ned. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Okay. But we’d better not get too close or the driver will become suspicious.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">79 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The  chase  led  beyond  the  borders  of  River  Heights,  and  Nancy  was  worried.  Would  the </p>
<p class="calibre2">police go back now and perhaps notify the State Troopers to continue the hunt? </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy said nothing to Ned, but she wished she had brought her own car with its CB radio. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Ned had driven his car to her home, and she had seen no reason to make a switch. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After they had traveled a good many miles, the driver ahead turned into a wooded area. The </p>
<p class="calibre2">dirt road twisted and turned until it finally led to an encampment. The main house seemed </p>
<p class="calibre2">to be a converted barn. For safety, Ned parked some distance away. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He  and  Nancy  jumped  out  and  quietly  but  quickly  hurried  forward.  They  encountered  no </p>
<p class="calibre2">one, since the people ahead of them had already gone inside. Cautiously the young people </p>
<p class="calibre2">went up to the nearest window and peered in. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">They  recognized  many  of  the  people  who  had  been  at  the  party.  They  were  standing </p>
<p class="calibre2">around,  still  in  their  ceremonial  robes,  but  the  scene  was  not  solemn.  The  cultists  were </p>
<p class="calibre2">talking and laughing loudly. One of them put on a record, and they began to dance singly or </p>
<p class="calibre2">in couples, going through strange gyrations. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Presently  two  men  walked  near  the  window,  which  was  partially  open.  They  were  Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Kampura and Benny the Slippery One Caputti! </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy  and  Ned  dodged  out  of  sight  but  remained  close  enough  to  listen.  Benny  Caputti </p>
<p class="calibre2">laughed raucously. “We certainly pulled that one off all right. Good thing those kids didn’t </p>
<p class="calibre2">see us and Rosina!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s right,” Kampura said. “Praise to the pearl and the lovely moon goddess.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Say, we brought so much food back, we’d better feed Moto,” Benny said. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Kampura chuckled. “Which one?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Not our Moto, of course. The sneaky little jeweler who caught on to us and is now sitting in </p>
<p class="calibre2">the dungeon!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“We  certainly  have  to  decide  what  we’ll  do  with  him  soon.  I  still  think  we  should  have </p>
<p class="calibre2">gotten rid of him right away.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy  and  Ned  looked  at  each  other.  Mr.  Moto  the  jeweler  was  the  prisoner  of  the  cult </p>
<p class="calibre2">people!  But  where  was he,  in the house, or one  of  the  other  buildings? They  wondered  if </p>
<p class="calibre2">the thieves had harmed him. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Kampura  and  Caputti  were  joined  by  a  third  man  who  snickered.  “It’s  a  good  thing  we </p>
<p class="calibre2">locked up that girl and her boyfriend. The nerve of them to crash the party!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The  three  men  moved  away  from  the  window,  and  Nancy  whispered  to  Ned,  “They  don’t </p>
<p class="calibre2">even know we’ve escaped!” </p>
<p class="calibre2">80 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“And  they  don’t  know  we  were  invited,”  Ned  added.  “I  wonder  who  called  you.”  Nancy </p>
<p class="calibre2">admitted she had no idea. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At that moment two other men passed the window and stopped near it. One of them said, </p>
<p class="calibre2">“We can’t leave that girl and her boyfriend in the hallway forever. Early tomorrow morning, </p>
<p class="calibre2">you go back and quietly unlock the doors.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">His companion grinned. “And give them some pearl soup!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Both  men  laughed  uproariously  but  were  interrupted  by  the  “goddess.”  She  reprimanded </p>
<p class="calibre2">them for their hilarity and suggested that everyone go to bed. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“There is work to be done in the morning,” she declared. “I have a new list of jewelry stores </p>
<p class="calibre2">for you to work on.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The woman clapped her hands. Everyone fell silent, and she commanded the cult members </p>
<p class="calibre2">to retire to their rooms. Within minutes everyone had left, and the lights were turned out. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy and Ned wondered where the police were. Had the River Heights men forgotten to </p>
<p class="calibre2">notify them. Or had the replacements not been able to follow Ned’s car? </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Are  you  game  to  go  inside  the  house  and  see  if  we  can  find  a  telephone  to  notify  the </p>
<p class="calibre2">police?” Nancy asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes. Let’s see if we can locate a door that isn’t locked.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Not  far from  where  they  were  standing  was  an open  door.  Nancy  and Ned  tiptoed  inside. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Before  them  was  a  flight  of  steps  with  another  door  at  the  top.  Ned  opened  it,  and  they </p>
<p class="calibre2">found themselves in a kitchen. It was in darkness, but a small flashlight Nancy pulled from </p>
<p class="calibre2">her  pocket  illuminated  their  way  to  another  door.  It  swung  open  noiselessly,  and  the  two </p>
<p class="calibre2">sleuths went into an elegantly furnished dining room. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">No telephone was in evidence. Nancy thought, “Perhaps ‘Mrs. Rossmeyer’ keeps it hidden.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The  two  young  people  proceeded  through  another  door  and  this  time  stood  stock-still, </p>
<p class="calibre2">gaping in astonishment. They were in a small room with a large glass case in the middle of it. </p>
<p class="calibre2">It  stood  on  a  pedestal,  and  in  the  center,  swathed  in  purple  velvet,  was  the  form  of  a </p>
<p class="calibre2">woman’s  neck  and  shoulders.  A  light  in  the  top  of  the  case  shone  on  an  exquisite  pearl </p>
<p class="calibre2">necklace draped over the form. Nancy counted the pearls. There were twelve on each side </p>
<p class="calibre2">of a huge, magnificent center one with a slightly pinkish cast! </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy and Ned were stunned. Was this the one stolen from the real Mrs. Rossmeyer? Was it </p>
<p class="calibre2">the one her companion had brought to Mr. Moto for repairs? </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">81 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In front of the glass case, three figures in white hooded robes were kneeling on the floor. </p>
<p class="calibre2">They  remained  in  that  position  and  gave  no  indication  that  they  had  seen  or  heard  the </p>
<p class="calibre2">young people. Every few seconds they glanced up at the necklace with adoring eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy put her lips to Ned’s ear. “We must get the police!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The two retraced their steps through the dining room and kitchen and went outside. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Maybe  the  officers  lost  us  and  couldn’t  find  this  place,”  Ned  suggested.  “Why  don’t  we </p>
<p class="calibre2">walk up the road and wave them down?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy agreed, and they started off. As they hurried along the dirt road, they were suddenly </p>
<p class="calibre2">stopped  by  two  men  who  appeared  from  the  bushes  and  blocked  their  way  like  huge, </p>
<p class="calibre2">looming shadows! </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy  and  Ned  stood  frozen  to  the  spot.  Before  they  had  a  chance  to  think,  they  were </p>
<p class="calibre2">tackled  by  the  two  men.  As  the  young  couple  fought  desperately,  they  smelled  a  strong, </p>
<p class="calibre2">sweet  odor  coming  from  cloths  that  their  attackers  had  shoved  in  their  faces.  Nancy  and </p>
<p class="calibre2">Ned blacked out! </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
