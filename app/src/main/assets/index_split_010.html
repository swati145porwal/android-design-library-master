<h3 class="sigilNotInTOC">Night Scare </h3>

<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">WITH  the  threat  ringing  in  her  ears,  Nancy  jumped  out  of  bed.  The  voice  had  come  from </p>
<p class="calibre2">outside, so she ran to the window and was just in time to see a man reaching the bottom of </p>
<p class="calibre2">a tree. Evidently he had climbed it in order to call into Nancy’s room. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">She  ordered  him  to  stop,  but  knew  it  was  useless.  Quickly  she  grabbed  her  flashlight  and </p>
<p class="calibre2">pointed  it  toward  the  intruder.  By  now  he  was  rushing  toward  some  bushes.  The  light </p>
<p class="calibre2">revealed that he was short, had thick, shiny black hair and wore a gray suit! </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This  was  the  description  Mrs.  Rooney  had  given  of  the  man  whom  she  had  seen  running </p>
<p class="calibre2">from Mr. Moto’s store! Could he be Benny Caputti? </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy concluded that the incident should be reported to the police, and that a guard should </p>
<p class="calibre2">be posted at the house if the Drews were to remain there. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">She put on her robe and slippers and went to her father’s room. When he was fully awake, </p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy told him what had happened. He was greatly disturbed, realizing that the man who </p>
<p class="calibre2">had climbed the tree might have entered Nancy’s room and harmed her! </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">43 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I like your idea of a guard,” he told his daughter. “In the morning we’ll talk it over with the </p>
<p class="calibre2">Mises. Actually, I’m embarrassed staying here and putting them through all this trouble. We </p>
<p class="calibre2">should offer to move at once.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr.  Drew  went  to  the  telephone  and  called  police  headquarters.  He  reported  that  a  man </p>
<p class="calibre2">had been roaming around the Mise property who matched Caputti’s description. The officer </p>
<p class="calibre2">on duty promised to look out for the suspect. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy finally went back to bed but found it hard to sleep, even though she had closed her </p>
<p class="calibre2">window  and  pulled  down  the  bamboo  shade.  Finally  she  dozed  off  and  dreamed  about </p>
<p class="calibre2">climbing up and down trees after Benny the Slippery One Caputti, but never catching him. </p>
<p class="calibre2">She  slept  later  than  usual,  but  no  one  disturbed  the  weary  detective.  When  Nancy  finally </p>
<p class="calibre2">came to breakfast, her father and the Mises were already eating. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy bowed low, which seemed to please her hosts, and said good morning. Mr. Drew had </p>
<p class="calibre2">already told  the  Mises what  had happened  the  evening before.  “I  mentioned, Nancy, that </p>
<p class="calibre2">you  and  I  felt  we  should  leave  and  not  put  our  kind  friends  to  any  more  trouble.  They </p>
<p class="calibre2">wouldn’t listen to my proposition. I guess I’m losing my ability to sell an idea.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“That is not the reason!” Mrs. Mise objected. “We are very interested in the case and want </p>
<p class="calibre2">to do all we can to help you solve it. That is why we insist you remain here.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr. Mise changed the subject by showing the Drews the morning paper. For the benefit of </p>
<p class="calibre2">his  guests, he had thoughtfully bought  an English  edition.  He pointed  to  a  headline  which </p>
<p class="calibre2">read:Daring Robbery in Jewelry Store </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Only One Valuable Piece Stolen! </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The  article  said  that  the  theft  was  most  unusual.  Although  the  shop  had  a  burglar  alarm </p>
<p class="calibre2">system, it had not been set off, and the police were at a loss to explain why. Also, they were </p>
<p class="calibre2">puzzled  by  the  fact  that  the  only  article  taken  was  a  necklace  containing  25  pearls.  The </p>
<p class="calibre2">center pearl was very large and on each side of it were 12 smaller ones. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“That sounds like Mrs. Rossmeyer’s!” Nancy exclaimed. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“It does, indeed,” Mr. Drew agreed. “What do you think happened?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Benny  the  Slippery  One  comes  to  mind,”  she  replied.  “I  don’t  know  how  he  got  his </p>
<p class="calibre2">nickname, but it could mean that he knows how to turn off burglar alarms and slip in and </p>
<p class="calibre2">out of jewelry stores unnoticed.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“You are talking about the same man who climbed the tree last night and called into your </p>
<p class="calibre2">room?” Mrs. Mise asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2">44 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“But how could he do two things at the same time?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Does the article mention what time the robbery took place, Nancy?” Mr. Drew asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“It could have been any time after closing yesterday. When the store’s custodian arrived at </p>
<p class="calibre2">five-thirty  this  morning,  he  discovered  that  the  alarm  had  been  turned  off.  Thinking  this </p>
<p class="calibre2">strange, he called the owner of the shop. The man came immediately and discovered that </p>
<p class="calibre2">the valuable necklace was missing. He phoned the police and they, in turn, gave the item to </p>
<p class="calibre2">the newspaper just before it went to press.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“So Benny had plenty of time for the burglary, either before or after he climbed the tree,” </p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy said. “I certainly wish I could find out if that necklace was Mrs. Rossmeyer’s.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Possibly World Wide Gems sold it to that jewelry store,” Mr. Drew added, “and then Benny </p>
<p class="calibre2">or someone working for him went to get it back.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“To make more money by reselling it!” Mrs. Mise added. “What a racket!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Just  then  the  telephone  rang.  Hannah  Gruen  was  calling  and  said  that  Mr.  Drew  should </p>
<p class="calibre2">phone his office as soon as it was open. “Meanwhile, I’ll talk to Nancy,” she added. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The  young  sleuth  was  delighted  with  what  Hannah  had  to  tell  her.  Ned  Nickerson,  Burt </p>
<p class="calibre2">Eddleton,  and  Dave  Evans  were  coming  to  River  Heights  to  visit  Nancy, George,  and  Bess. </p>
<p class="calibre2">They wanted to know how soon Nancy would be home. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I told them I thought in about a week,” Hannah remarked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’ll  certainly  be  there  by  then,”  Nancy  agreed.  “Dad  and  I  hope  to  wind  up  the  mystery </p>
<p class="calibre2">soon.” She told Hannah what happened since the Drews had arrived in Japan. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">When she came to the part about Caputti climbing the tree and calling into her room, the </p>
<p class="calibre2">motherly housekeeper gasped. “Oh, Nancy dear, please watch your step!” she begged. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Don’t worry, Hannah,” Nancy replied. “I’m doing my best. This is a very puzzling case.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After good-by’s had been said, Nancy wondered what to do next. An idea came to her. She </p>
<p class="calibre2">said to her father, “Let’s go outdoors and see if we can find any clues to the man who was </p>
<p class="calibre2">here last night.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The two  excused  themselves  and  walked  into  the  garden. Near  the bushes  through  which </p>
<p class="calibre2">the suspect had gone were footprints! </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“These  are  strange,” Nancy said.  “It’s  not  a  complete  impression,  just the  ball of  the  foot. </p>
<p class="calibre2">We can’t deduce much from this, but let’s see where the prints lead.” </p>
<p class="calibre2">45 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“The fugitive must have been running very fast because only the forward part of the foot is </p>
<p class="calibre2">showing,”  Mr.  Drew  commented.  “He  was  literally  on  his  toes.  Nancy,  what  can  you  tell </p>
<p class="calibre2">from these prints?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“That  the  man  is  short.  He  takes  short  steps  but  doesn’t  leap.  I’d  say  he’s  an  excellent </p>
<p class="calibre2">runner. This may be another reason for his nickname, Benny the Slippery One, if he, indeed, </p>
<p class="calibre2">was the intruder.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Drews followed the shoe prints until they ended in the street, where it was impossible </p>
<p class="calibre2">to trace them any further. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy  and  her  father  returned  to  where  they  had  started  their  search  and  examined  the </p>
<p class="calibre2">area  between  the  bushes  and  the  tree.  Here  the  ground  was  firmer  and  no  prints  were </p>
<p class="calibre2">visible. The Drews looked carefully at the bark of the tree, thinking its roughness might have </p>
<p class="calibre2">snagged something from the man’s clothing. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Soon Nancy detected  a few  thin,  wooly,  gray threads.  “Dad!  These  could  be from  Benny’s </p>
<p class="calibre2">suit!” she exclaimed. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“You’re right,” Mr. Drew replied after examining the evidence closely. “I’m sure the police </p>
<p class="calibre2">would like to see them.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Carefully Nancy deposited the find in her pocketbook. “I wonder why he has such a liking for </p>
<p class="calibre2">gray suits,” she mused, then began to search around the tree. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A few seconds later, the girl sleuth cried out, “Oh, Dad, I’ve found another good clue!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
