<h3 class="sigilNotInTOC">Nancy Accused </h3>

<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">NANCY had to make up her mind in a hurry whether to try to get away from the man or turn </p>
<p class="calibre2">the tables on him and prove that he had helped a criminal escape. </p>
<p class="calibre2">35 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In  the  distance  she  saw  her  father  running  in  her  direction.  He  had  called  another  guard, </p>
<p class="calibre2">who was hurrying along with him. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">By the time Nancy’s adversary realized that he was about to be caught, he let go of her and </p>
<p class="calibre2">started to run. But the girl grabbed his wrist and held on tightly. Tug as he would, he could </p>
<p class="calibre2">not get away before Mr. Drew and the other guard had caught up. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“What’s going on here?” the lawyer demanded. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Before the suspect could answer, the guard who had accompanied Mr. Drew spoke up. “This </p>
<p class="calibre2">man is not one of us!” He turned to the impostor. “Who are you?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The man did not reply, so Nancy told her story and her suspicion that he was in league with </p>
<p class="calibre2">a man who was wanted by numerous United States authorities. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I will take him into custody and hold him until he talks,” the legitimate guard declared. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He  asked  the  impostor  where  he  had  obtained  the  uniform.  The  suspect  stared  defiantly, </p>
<p class="calibre2">but said nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy tried to catch him by surprise. “Where did Benny Caputti go?” she asked him. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The prisoner jumped and blinked, indicating that the girl had touched upon a vital subject. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Still he did not talk. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“It is against the law to impersonate an officer,” the guard declared. “You will have to come </p>
<p class="calibre2">with me!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly  the  suspect  cried  out,  “Why  don’t  you  arrest  this  girl?  She  molested  a  visitor, </p>
<p class="calibre2">trying to photograph him against his will. See her camera? She was bothering people with </p>
<p class="calibre2">it.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy  and  her  father  were  startled,  but  Nancy  said  calmly,  “He’s  trying  to  twist  things </p>
<p class="calibre2">around.  The  fellow  who  fled,  and  who  I  believe  is  in  league  with  this  man,  took  my </p>
<p class="calibre2">photograph. That’s why I chased him.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The guard nodded and handcuffed the prisoner. “I understand. Just give me your names and </p>
<p class="calibre2">addresses in case the police want to contact you.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Drews did, but before leaving Nara, they went to headquarters and told the full story. </p>
<p class="calibre2">They suggested that the chief get in touch with United States Authorities regarding Caputti </p>
<p class="calibre2">and the suspect, who evidently acted as a bodyguard for Benny the Slippery One. The officer </p>
<p class="calibre2">thanked them for the information and promised to look into the matter. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">36 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">When the Drews and the Mises reached home late next afternoon, they found Haruka, the </p>
<p class="calibre2">delightful maid whom the family employed, had arranged a special dinner. The reason was </p>
<p class="calibre2">that it was Mrs. Mise’s birthday! </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Haruka had made paper bird and flower decorations using the famous Oregami method. She </p>
<p class="calibre2">had hung them in various parts of the dining room. On the table she had put live flowers of </p>
<p class="calibre2">various  colors  interspersed  with  green  vines.  In  one  corner  of  the  room,  the  maid  had </p>
<p class="calibre2">placed  a  huge  jardiniere  and  filled  it  with  lavender  wisteria  that  gently  drooped  over  the </p>
<p class="calibre2">sides. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Haruka served a delicious dinner that included strips of fish with rice and fried vegetables. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Warm  sake,  a  wine  made  from  rice,  was  served with  the  meal.  Dessert  consisted  of  a flat </p>
<p class="calibre2">piece of plain cake in which the center was scooped out and had been replaced with half of </p>
<p class="calibre2">a large, ripe peach. Over it she had poured a hot, pink peach sauce, and she had decorated </p>
<p class="calibre2">around the edge with scattered peach leaves. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone  enjoyed  the  delicious  meal,  and  they  each  proposed  toasts  to  wish  Mrs.  Mise  a </p>
<p class="calibre2">happy  birthday.  When  dinner  was  over,  Haruka  brought  in  a  large  cage  with  hundreds  of </p>
<p class="calibre2">gorgeous butterflies in it. She announced that this was her personal gift to Mrs. Mise. She </p>
<p class="calibre2">had recently been on vacation and had collected them herself. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“They are beautiful!” Mrs. Mise told her, then translated for the Drews. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“You  know  my  love  for  the  colors  blue  and  yellow,”  she  continued.  “How  exquisite  these </p>
<p class="calibre2">butterflies are.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone stood up to look at the fluttering creatures. Nancy liked a particular one that had </p>
<p class="calibre2">various shades of blue from light to dark from its center to the wing tips. Mr. Drew’s favorite </p>
<p class="calibre2">was a reddish brown butterfly with black spots on its wings. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After the excitement about the gift had subsided, Mr. Mise gave his wife his presento. It was </p>
<p class="calibre2">a high comb studded with pearls for his wife’s hair. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“How beautiful!” Nancy exclaimed. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“My husband is a most kind man,” Mrs. Mise said. “This is a lovely way to remind me of this </p>
<p class="calibre2">birthday.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy and her father were sorry they had not known about the special occasion and did not </p>
<p class="calibre2">have a gift for their hostess. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly  Nancy  laughed.  “Dad,”  she  said,  “we  brought  presentos  for  the  Mises  from  the </p>
<p class="calibre2">United  States.  In  all  the excitement  about  villains  we  completely  forgot!”  She  asked  to be </p>
<p class="calibre2">excused,  went  upstairs,  and  got  the  gifts  from  her  suitcase.  She  brought  them  down  and </p>
<p class="calibre2">handed a package to each of their friends. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">37 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr. Mise’s presento was a new type of fountain pen. After thanking the Drews, he said that </p>
<p class="calibre2">he was delighted to own one of them, since they had not yet reached the Japanese market. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">His wife’s gift was a dainty lace handkerchief. It had been made by a nun who was an expert </p>
<p class="calibre2">at needlecraft. She had learned the art in Belgium. Mrs. Mise was thrilled with the presento. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Further conversation was interrupted by the ringing of the telephone. Haruka answered and </p>
<p class="calibre2">said that it was for Mr. Drew and Miss Nancy. When Mr. Drew said hello, there was a click </p>
<p class="calibre2">on the line, and it went dead. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy and her father looked at each other. Was this a hoax, or was Mr. Caputti trying to find </p>
<p class="calibre2">out whether the Drews had returned to the Mises’ home? </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The lawyer asked Haruka if she had any idea from where the call had come. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“It was from overseas, sir,” she said. “I am so sorry you were interrupted.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A few minutes went by and the phone rang again. This time Mr. Drew answered it himself. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Is this the Mise home?” a man asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Am I speaking with Mr. Drew?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“This is Professor Joji Mise in River Heights,” the caller identified himself. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m glad to hear from you,” Mr. Drew said. “Did you just call a few minutes ago and were </p>
<p class="calibre2">interrupted?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes. I had to try again. Unfortunately, I have bad news for you.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy,  who  stood  close  enough  to  the  receiver  to  overhear  the  conversation,  felt  a  chill </p>
<p class="calibre2">going down her spine. Instantly she thought of Mr. Moto and Mr. Kikichi. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I  have  just  learned,”  the  professor  went  on,  “that  burglars  broke  into  Mr.  Moto’s  shop. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Chief McGinnis asked me to tell you about it. They took everything in the place.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“That is, indeed, bad news,” Mr. Drew remarked. “What about Mr. Kikichi?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“He was beaten unconscious and taken to the hospital. But he is all right now.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Are there any clues to the burglars?” Mr. Drew inquired. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">38 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes,  the  police  think  that  Benny  Caputti  and  his  wife  were  responsible.  Further </p>
<p class="calibre2">investigation  revealed  that  they  might  have  fled  to  Japan.  We  thought  you  should  know </p>
<p class="calibre2">this.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr.  Drew  told  the  professor  of  their  trip  to  Nara.  “My  daughter  believes  she  spotted  Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Caputti  but  was  stopped  from  pursuing  him  by  a  fake  guard.”  He  gave  the  details  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre2">event, and the professor suggested that the Drews try to locate the couple. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“We’ll do our best,” Mr. Drew promised. “I suppose the River Heights police are working on </p>
<p class="calibre2">this, but we may find some good leads here.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Fine. I will report this to the chief. And now I would like to say hello to my brother and his </p>
<p class="calibre2">wife.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As Mr. Drew said good-by to the professor and handed the phone to Mr. Mise, Nancy felt </p>
<p class="calibre2">frustrated.  Not  only  had  they  failed  to  find  Mr.  Moto,  but  now  all  his  property  had  been </p>
<p class="calibre2">stolen!  While  she  and  her  father  discussed  the  case,  she  did  not  know  that  a  good  lead </p>
<p class="calibre2">would turn up soon. The Mises joined them a few minutes later, but their conversation was </p>
<p class="calibre2">interrupted again when the phone rang a third time. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The  call  was  for  Nancy.  It  proved  to  be  from  the  chief  of  the  Tokyo  police  force.  “We  are </p>
<p class="calibre2">holding  a  woman  here  who  has  been  using  a  phony  passport,”  the  officer  told  her.  “She </p>
<p class="calibre2">resembles the description you gave us of a suspect the other day. Is it possible for you to </p>
<p class="calibre2">come here to identify her?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
