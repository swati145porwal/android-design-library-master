<h3 class="sigilNotInTOC">Sudden Flight </h3>

<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">10 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">WHEN  Chief  McGinnis  finished  his  phone  call,  he  looked  at  Nancy  and  grinned.  “Young </p>
<p class="calibre2">lady,” he said, “are you getting mixed up with underworld characters?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The girl smiled back. “Not if I can help it,” she replied. “But if there’s one for me to  catch, </p>
<p class="calibre2">you know I’ll certainly go after himl” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, watch your step,” the officer advised. “The Caputti’s are suspected of having commit </p>
<p class="calibre2">ted a number of crimes, but nothing could ever be proved against them.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I  don’t  want  to  see  that  Rosina  Caputti  again!”  Bess  declared.  “She  has  a  horrible  ex </p>
<p class="calibre2">pression on her face, and her eyes bored right through me in Mr. Moto’s shop.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy remarked, “You said Caputti is a jewel thief. Does he specialize in pearls?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes, although he’ll take along anything that’s handy,” the chief replied. “Why do you ask?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Because  that’s  what  Mr.  Moto  works  with  primarily,”  Nancy  replied.  “I’d  like  to  find  out </p>
<p class="calibre2">more about pearls.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“You should call on Professor Joji Mise,” Chief McGinnis told her. “He is Japanese and has </p>
<p class="calibre2">lived in this country a long time teaching Japanese art. He’s a most interesting person, and </p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m  sure  he  can  give  you  lots  of  information  about pearls  and the  customs  of  his  country. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Tell the professor I suggested you get in touch with him.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The girls thanked Chief McGinnis and left headquarters. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Let’s call on Professor Mise this afternoon,” Nancy suggested as they climbed back into her </p>
<p class="calibre2">car. “We can have lunch at my house first.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Bess and George agreed. Later, when they were about to leave the Drew home, Nancy’s dog </p>
<p class="calibre2">Togo, a frisky bull terrier, barked and whined. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“He wants to come along,” said Nancy. “Listen, old fellow, if I take you, will you behave?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Togo wagged his tail vigorously, which meant that he was promising to be good on the trip. </p>
<p class="calibre2">He jumped into the passenger seat in the front, so Bess and George climbed into the rear. </p>
<p class="calibre2">When  they  reached  the  Mise  house,  Nancy  left  Togo  in  the  car  and  opened  the  four </p>
<p class="calibre2">windows part way for air. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The  girls  found  Professor  Mise  at  home.  He  proved  to  be  charming,  and  his  wife  a  lovely, </p>
<p class="calibre2">dainty lady. He considered the police chief a good friend and a very fine officer. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy  asked  the  professor  about  his  native  country,  and  he  began  to  describe  Japan,  its </p>
<p class="calibre2">customs, and some of its history. As he was talking, a large, beautiful tortoise-shell-colored </p>
<p class="calibre2">cat wandered into the room, jumped up on the sofa, and settled down to go to sleep. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“What a beautiful animal!” Nancy remarked. </p>
<p class="calibre2">11 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Professor  Mise  told  her  that  it  was  a  mike-neko.  “They  are  a  great  rarity,  and  among </p>
<p class="calibre2">Japanese  fishermen  there’s  a  superstition  that  these  cats  can  make  accurate  weather </p>
<p class="calibre2">forecasts. Japanese sailors often have one or more aboard their vessels. It is even said that </p>
<p class="calibre2">they are a charm against shipwreck.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“How interesting!” said Bess, who owned a cat, but admitted it was not as beautiful as this </p>
<p class="calibre2">one. Then she requested that the professor tell them something about the history of pearls. </p>
<p class="calibre2">“They’re only found in the waters of Asia, aren’t they?” she asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, no. Pearl oysters live in many parts of the world,” the professor replied. “Did you know </p>
<p class="calibre2">that even American Indians prized pearls and wore strands of them?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The girls shook their heads, and their host continued. “Not every tribe did, mostly the ones </p>
<p class="calibre2">along the seashore. Indians in Virginia, for instance, liked necklaces, beads, and sometimes </p>
<p class="calibre2">even anklets made from pearls.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">George spoke up. “How did you find out about this?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The  professor  said  that  it  was  reported  in  old  documents  by  white  settlers  of  the  17th </p>
<p class="calibre2">century.  “Even  in  Ohio,”  he  went  on,  “which  is not  on the ocean,  skeletons  with pearls  in </p>
<p class="calibre2">their mouths were found dating back to the era of mound builders.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">George raised her eyebrows. ‘In their mouths?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I  suppose  the  Indians  believed  that  the  healing  propensities  of  the  pearl  would  be </p>
<p class="calibre2">beneficial for the dead person’s journey to the happy hunting grounds. You know that the </p>
<p class="calibre2">pearl was used for medicinal purposes when that science was still in its infancy. In India, for </p>
<p class="calibre2">instance, people used to insert one or more pearls in the wounds of injured warriors to help </p>
<p class="calibre2">them heal.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Do pearls last forever?” Bess asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I do not know about forever, but one pearl found in a Japanese storehouse was a thousand </p>
<p class="calibre2">years  old.  After  the  dust  had  been  removed,  it  turned  out  that  the  pearl  had  retained  its </p>
<p class="calibre2">original luster.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“How marvelous!” Bess exclaimed. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Just  then  Nancy  heard  Togo  barking.  She  looked  out  the  window  in  time  to  see  him  leap </p>
<p class="calibre2">from the car. He ran to the house and whined to be allowed to come in. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy went to the front door to chastise her pet, but the dog  had other ideas. He scooted </p>
<p class="calibre2">past her into the living room, where he heard voices. Suddenly he spied the cat on the sofa. </p>
<p class="calibre2">He shot across the room and barked furiously at the animal. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">12 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The mike-neko stood up and arched its back. Togo put his paws on the couch and yapped at </p>
<p class="calibre2">the cat. Frightened, it jumped onto a table, knocking over a beautiful Japanese vase. Nancy </p>
<p class="calibre2">made a dive for her pet and grabbed him by the collar. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“You  naughty,  naughty  dog!”  she  exclaimed  and  took  him  back  to  the  car.  This  time  she </p>
<p class="calibre2">closed the windows a little more so he could not get out again. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">She returned to the house and apologized for Togo’s actions. “I’m dreadfully sorry about the </p>
<p class="calibre2">vase,” she said. “May I have it mended or replace it? I would feel much better about this.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mrs. Mise had taken hold of her cat. She turned to Nancy. “You are not responsible for this </p>
<p class="calibre2">mishap. I would not think of permitting you to buy us another one.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Although Nancy was very insistent, her host and hostess would not give in. To help the girl </p>
<p class="calibre2">over her embarrassment, the professor went on talking about Japan and pearls. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He  mentioned  that  for  thousands  of  years,  people  knew  only  of  natural  pearls  found  in </p>
<p class="calibre2">oysters. “Then came the industry of pearl culture,” he said. “Today it is one of the biggest </p>
<p class="calibre2">businesses in Japan. You really should visit that group of beautiful islands and see one of the </p>
<p class="calibre2">culture farms.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Just how are cultured pearls made?” George asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“As far as the oyster is concerned, the same way as ‘natural’ pearls. It happens when a small </p>
<p class="calibre2">foreign object gets inside the shell, like a grain of sand, for instance. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“In  the  pearl  beds,  man  helps this process  by  inserting  a  sphere  ranging  in  diameter  from </p>
<p class="calibre2">two  to  ten  millimeters.  These  nuclei  come  from  the  shell  of  freshwater  bivalves  and  are </p>
<p class="calibre2">polished prior to their use.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’ll bet the oyster doesn’t like that one bit!” Bess declared. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“True.  It  annoys  the  oyster  so  much  that  it  gives  off  a  fluid  called  nacre.  This  coats  the </p>
<p class="calibre2">offending object and hardens. The result is a pearl.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Then cultured pearls are really not imitations,” George said. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, no. Today that is practically all you can buy because few natural pearls are fished any </p>
<p class="calibre2">more. But in ancient times, divers searched the deep water for the oysters. They risked their </p>
<p class="calibre2">health,  and  many  times  their  lives,  hunting  for  pearls,  which  only  royalty  and  aristocrats </p>
<p class="calibre2">were allowed to wear.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“How mean!” Bess said. “That seems very unfair.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Her cousin George could not resist teasing her. “Why Bess, I always thought you wanted to </p>
<p class="calibre2">be a queen!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">13 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Bess made a face, but did not comment. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Professor  Mise  said,  “My  brother  and  his  wife  live  just  outside  Tokyo.  If  you  are  ever  in </p>
<p class="calibre2">Japan, you must look them up. You would be welcome at their home, and my brother, who </p>
<p class="calibre2">is retired from government work, would take you to one of the culture farms.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">George smiled. “Is it a Japanese custom to invite people to your brother’s home?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The  Mises  laughed.  “In  a  way,  yes,”  the  professor  replied.  “But  we  invite  only  people  we </p>
<p class="calibre2">like.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Such a trip would be very exciting,” Nancy said. “But  right now I can’t leave here because </p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m working on a case for Mr. Moto, the jeweler.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, I know Mr. Moto well,” the professor said. “A very nice man.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The girls and the Mises talked for a while longer about pearls and Japan, then Nancy and her </p>
<p class="calibre2">friends stood up to say good-by. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Please  visit  us  again  soon,”  Mrs.  Mise  said.  “We  will  be  glad  to  tell  you  more  about  our </p>
<p class="calibre2">country.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The girls promised to do so, then thanked their hosts and left. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The  following  morning,  Nancy  suggested  going  to  Mr.  Moto’s  shop  again.  Perhaps  he  had </p>
<p class="calibre2">heard from Mrs. Rossmeyer or had another idea as to who might have stolen her necklace. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">When  the  girls  walked  through  the  door,  they  were  surprised  to  see  a  stranger  standing </p>
<p class="calibre2">behind the counter. Nancy inquired about Mr. Moto and was told that the jeweler had left </p>
<p class="calibre2">very hurriedly for Japan. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“My name is Kikichi,” the man explained. “I am a friend. Mr. Moto asked me to take care of </p>
<p class="calibre2">his shop while he is away. May I help you?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Did Mr. Moto say why he was leaving?” Nancy asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“No. He did not.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Does he have any relatives in Japan?” George asked. “Perhaps it was a family emergency?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I do not know. He did not say.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy  wondered  if  by  chance  the  jeweler  had  received  a  lead  to  Mrs.  Rossmeyer’s  stolen </p>
<p class="calibre2">necklace and had gone to retrieve it. But why had he not called her? </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">All three girls felt that Mr. Moto’s sudden disappearance was quite strange. Was Mr. Kikichi </p>
<p class="calibre2">telling the truth, or was he covering up a secret or foul play? </p>
<p class="calibre2">14 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">To verify his story, the girls began looking around the shop, admiring the various art objects. </p>
<p class="calibre2">They called back and forth to Mr. Kikichi asking questions and receiving answers. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy drifted toward the back room where Mr. Moto had lain down to sleep the previous </p>
<p class="calibre2">day. She wanted to look inside for clues. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As she came closer, Mr. Kikichi called out, “This way. Don’t go back there! Come this way!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy pretended not to hear him and hurried into the room despite his orders. She stopped </p>
<p class="calibre2">short in amazement. The place was a shambles! </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
