<h3 class="sigilNotInTOC">Phony Papers </h3>

<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“WHAT else does the newspaper article say?” Nancy asked Mrs. Mise. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Japanese woman continued to read, then translated. “The police have been unable to </p>
<p class="calibre2">locate  Mrs.  Rossmeyer  since  the  theft.  Newsmen  and  friends  have  not  heard  from  her </p>
<p class="calibre2">either.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mrs. Mise went on reading. “It was conjectured that Mrs. Rossmeyer might have left for the </p>
<p class="calibre2">United States. Police and friends have said that oftentimes, on a whim, she would pack up, </p>
<p class="calibre2">leave wherever she was, and not tell anyone where she was going. Then suddenly she would </p>
<p class="calibre2">turn up in a different country.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“She might have gone home to River Heights,” Nancy speculated. “One thing we have never </p>
<p class="calibre2">asked about is the companion who is said to travel with her. Was she with Mrs. Rossmeyer? </p>
<p class="calibre2">Is she mixed up in the jewel racket?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr.  Mise  spoke  up.  “Would  you  like  me  to  call  the  newspaper  and  ask  if  they  have  any </p>
<p class="calibre2">information about the woman?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Please do,” Nancy replied. </p>
<p class="calibre2">62 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr. Mise went to the phone. He returned in a short time to say that when last seen, Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Rossmeyer’s companion was with her. “Would you like to go to headquarters and talk to the </p>
<p class="calibre2">chief?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes,” Nancy and her father replied together. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The chief had little to add to the newspaper story, but while his visitors waited, he made  a </p>
<p class="calibre2">long distance call to the chief of police in Rome. Then he reported that an investigation had </p>
<p class="calibre2">been  made,  and  anyone  who  might  have  any  information  on  the  jewel  theft  or  the </p>
<p class="calibre2">whereabouts of Mrs. Rossmeyer had been questioned thoroughly. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“One  person  overheard  the  two  women  talking  about  returning  to  the  United  States,”  he </p>
<p class="calibre2">added. “But someone else had heard them mention that they would go to Paris. Where they </p>
<p class="calibre2">went, nobody knows.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy asked him what he knew about World Wide Gem’s recent business dealings.  When </p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy told of her theory regarding Mrs. Rossmeyer, the chief nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“We do not feel that she is involved in any dishonest dealings,” he said. “All the information </p>
<p class="calibre2">we have collected indicates that Mrs. Rossmeyer is not really active as an officer of  World </p>
<p class="calibre2">Wide Gems. It was advantageous for them to use her name, which is synonymous with fine </p>
<p class="calibre2">jewelry and good advertising. But we are still investigating all angles.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The telephone rang, and the chief answered. After a brief conversation he hung up and said, </p>
<p class="calibre2">“I  just had  a  message  from  Interpol.  Someone in  your  hometown  claims  to have  seen the </p>
<p class="calibre2">missing  Mr.  Moto  in  the  back  seat  of  an  automobile.  The  police  strongly  suspect  that  he </p>
<p class="calibre2">never left River Heights!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy and her father looked at each other. “I had almost come to the same conclusion,” she </p>
<p class="calibre2">said. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After thanking the chief, they drove back to the Mise home. Mrs. Mise had a message for </p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr. Drew. His office had called and indicated that it was important for him to return home </p>
<p class="calibre2">as soon as possible. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“In view of what we just heard at headquarters,” Mr. Drew said to Nancy, “I don’t think it </p>
<p class="calibre2">would  be  worthwhile  for  you  to  stay,  either.  Both  Mr.  Moto  and  Mrs.  Rossmeyer  are </p>
<p class="calibre2">obviously not in Japan, and I don’t believe you can do any more to locate Mr. Caputti than </p>
<p class="calibre2">the police can.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy agreed. She felt it was more important to follow the clue to Mr. Moto, who, she was </p>
<p class="calibre2">convinced now,  was  being  held  against  his  will  by someone  in  his  hometown.  Also,  in  the </p>
<p class="calibre2">back of her mind was the statement from Bess and George  that Ned, Burt, and Dave were </p>
<p class="calibre2">coming to visit the girls in River Heights. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Maybe they can help us hunt,” she thought. </p>
<p class="calibre2">63 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Drews told their hosts that they were planning to leave the following day. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, we must have a farewell party,” Mrs. Mise said at once. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s very sweet of you,” Nancy said, “but it is not necessary. Anyway, we are not giving </p>
<p class="calibre2">you enough time to plan anything.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mrs. Mise said, “Perhaps, as you say, there is not enough time to invite friends, but I suggest </p>
<p class="calibre2">that we go to Mr. Mise’s club this evening. It has a very fine restaurant, and I think you will </p>
<p class="calibre2">enjoy the food there.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The  club  proved  to  be  not  only  an  excellent  place  to  eat,  but  it  was  filled  with  many </p>
<p class="calibre2">interesting art objects. A lovely Japanese girl named Lei greeted them. She wore a beautiful </p>
<p class="calibre2">flowered satin kimono with a contrasting obi. She had a very fetching high hair-do accented </p>
<p class="calibre2">by  combs.  Lei  showed  them  several  charming  old  pictures  of  Japanese  life  as  it  was </p>
<p class="calibre2">hundreds of years ago. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr.  Drew  was  particularly  interested  in  pictures  of  old-time  Japanese fishermen  using the </p>
<p class="calibre2">cormorant  bird  to  make  their  catch.  They  held  the  bird  like  a  kite  on  a  string.  When  the </p>
<p class="calibre2">cormorant  swooped  down  to  the  water  and  scooped  up  a  fish  in  its  bill,  the  fisherman </p>
<p class="calibre2">would quickly pull it in and take the catch! </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“The poor cormorant!” Nancy said. “He worked so hard for nothing.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Their guide smiled. “I venture to say that the fishermen allowed the birds to have their fill </p>
<p class="calibre2">after they did their job.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Next  to  the  pictures,  Lei  showed  them  jeweled crowns,  which  she  said had  been  worn  by </p>
<p class="calibre2">royal children in various countries. She pointed to one, which she said was Russian. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Long  ago  girls usually married  young  in  that  country.  The  brides  were  shaved  in  order to </p>
<p class="calibre2">accommodate the crown jewels they would wear,” she explained. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">While  the  group  was  eating,  the  headwaiter  told  Mr.  Mise  that  he  had  read  about  the </p>
<p class="calibre2">disappearance of Mrs. Tanya Rossmeyer. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“She is a member of our club,” he remarked. “I hope nothing has happened to her. She was </p>
<p class="calibre2">here only a short while ago.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Did she by any chance mention to you where she was going after her visit to Rome?” Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Drew inquired. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“No. I have no idea. She frequently travels from place to place.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">When the group arrived home, Nancy and her father packed. They were booked to fly to the </p>
<p class="calibre2">United States the following evening. </p>
<p class="calibre2">64 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“It’s high time we get back and take up our work,” the lawyer said. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I can hardly wait,” Nancy added. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After breakfast, the young detective said she would like to go to the jail and try to talk to </p>
<p class="calibre2">Mrs. Caputti. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Maybe if I tell her I know a lot about the jewel thefts, she may break down and confess,” </p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy reasoned. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I doubt it,” her father said, “but I suppose it’s worth a try.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mrs.  Mise  offered  to  go  along,  and  when  the  two  arrived,  they  asked  to  see  the  warden. </p>
<p class="calibre2">After introducing themselves, they inquired whether it would be possible to speak to Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Caputti. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The warden smiled. “So sorry,” he said. “Her lawyer came here with certain papers and she </p>
<p class="calibre2">was released.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Released!” Nancy exclaimed. She was stunned. “But I’m sure there must be some mistake. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Mrs. Caputti’s husband is wanted in the United States, and we believe she works with him in </p>
<p class="calibre2">committing jewel robberies!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The warden shrugged. “I am certain you must be wrong. I told you, her lawyer came here </p>
<p class="calibre2">with the papers.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“What did he look like?” Nancy asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“He was tall for a Japanese, and powerfully built. Rather stern faced, I would say.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The truth dawned on the girl detective. “What was his name?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Mr. Kampura!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
