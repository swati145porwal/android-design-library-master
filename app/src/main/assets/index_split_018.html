<h3 class="sigilNotInTOC">The Weird Ceremony </h3>

<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">73 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">THE doorman at Mrs. Rossmeyer’s home did not question Nancy and Ned. They went into a </p>
<p class="calibre2">large  hall,  and  from  there  into  the  living  room  where  a  reception  line  had  formed.  Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Rossmeyer was heavily covered with jewelry from head to toe. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy was amazed that she wore no necklace, however. Her white satin dress was covered </p>
<p class="calibre2">with gems that sparkled in the artificial light. Even its standing collar and long sleeves were </p>
<p class="calibre2">embroidered with numerous pearls, diamonds, rubies, and emeralds. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“She’s decked out like a Christmas tree,” Ned whispered to Nancy. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The young sleuth suppressed a smile and stared at the woman. She did not look at all like </p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy had pictured her. She was very thin, had prominent cheek bones, and a determined-</p>
<p class="calibre2">looking chin. Her hair was straw-colored, and there was an overabundance of rouge on her </p>
<p class="calibre2">cheeks. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I expected her to be beautiful,” Nancy said to Ned in a low, disappointed tone. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He grunted almost inaudibly. “She lets her gems make up for her looks!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy glanced along the receiving line and around the room. She did not see Mr. Moto, the </p>
<p class="calibre2">jeweler. “I wonder where he is,” the young sleuth thought </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In  a  few  minutes,  she  and  Ned  moved  up  to  the  head  of  the  receiving  line,  where  Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Rossmeyer  was  shaking  hands  with  various  guests,  kissing  some,  and  whispering  into  one </p>
<p class="calibre2">woman’s ear. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">When Nancy reached the hostess, the girl said, “We appreciate your invitation. Your party is </p>
<p class="calibre2">wonderful.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">On the spur of the moment she decided not to use her right name. “I’m Nan Drewry,” she </p>
<p class="calibre2">added, “and this is my friend, Edward Nickson.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mrs.  Rossmeyer  stared  hard  at  them  but  made  no  comment.  She  turned  to  the  Japanese </p>
<p class="calibre2">man on her left “I would like you to meet Mr. Moto,” she said. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Startled,  Nancy  shook  hands  with  him  and  asked,  “By  any  chance  are  you  related  to  Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Moto, the jeweler from River Heights?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“No, I am not,” was the answer. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ned  shook  hands  with  the  slightly  built  man,  but  asked  no  further  question.  “I  hope  you </p>
<p class="calibre2">enjoy your trip to Japan,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I am sure I will,” Mr. Moto replied, and the couple moved on. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">74 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">They mingled with the crowd, but realized  that they knew no one, and none of the guests </p>
<p class="calibre2">spoke to them. So their conversation was confined to admiring the gorgeous paintings, rugs, </p>
<p class="calibre2">and tapestries with which the mansion was furnished. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As  they  walked  back  into  the  center  hall,  Nancy  and  Ned  heard  a  strange  noise  upstairs. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Curious,  they  went  to  the  second  floor.  In  one  of  the  beautifully  furnished  bedrooms,  an </p>
<p class="calibre2">elderly American woman, dressed in evening attire and wearing a lot of pearl jewelry, was </p>
<p class="calibre2">seated on the side of a bed. She rocked back and forth rhythmically, muttering to herself. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">She  paid  no  attention  when  Nancy  and  Ned  walked  through  the  open  door.  Wondering  if </p>
<p class="calibre2">the  woman  were  ill  and  needed  help,  Nancy  went  closer. The  old  lady was  mumbling  in  a </p>
<p class="calibre2">sing-song voice. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ned  grabbed  Nancy’s  arm.  “She’s  nuts!”  he  whispered.  “If  I  were  you,  I  wouldn’t  get  too </p>
<p class="calibre2">near her. You never can tell what people like that will do. She may attack you!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy heeded Ned’s warning but listened carefully to the muttering. Finally she managed to </p>
<p class="calibre2">distinguish a few words. “Sacred nacre, moon, high tides.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The  woman  was  not  only  rocking,  but  rolling  her  eyes  from  one  side  to  the  other.  She </p>
<p class="calibre2">repeated the same words over and over and added, “Full moon, beautiful shell, lovely pink.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy  whispered  to  Ned,  “These  terms  were  used  in  ancient  times  in  the  pearl  cults.” </p>
<p class="calibre2">Quickly she explained a little about this to him then added, “Maybe this woman belongs to a </p>
<p class="calibre2">modern pearl-worshipping cult!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ned looked disgusted. “She belongs in a funny farm!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy hardly  paid  attention to  what he  was  saying. She  wondered  if the  woman  was  in a </p>
<p class="calibre2">trance,  or  for  some  reason,  was  she  acting?  The  stranger  finally  stopped  muttering  and </p>
<p class="calibre2">began to moan, her voice rising and falling. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ned said, “I can’t stand any more of this. It’s driving me off my rocker!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy  consented  to  leave.  When  they  walked  out  of  the  bedroom,  an  American  man  in </p>
<p class="calibre2">evening  clothes  came up  to them.  He  smiled  and  said,  “Mrs.  Rossmeyer  would  like to  see </p>
<p class="calibre2">you in her private quarters.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ned  hesitated,  looking  at Nancy.  He  felt  they  might  be  walking  into  a trap.  Nancy nodded </p>
<p class="calibre2">almost imperceptably, then started to follow the man. Ned went along reluctantly. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The  stranger  led  them  down  the  long  hallway  to  a  door.  He  clicked  on  a  wall  light,  then </p>
<p class="calibre2">opened  the  door.  Nancy  and  Ned  saw  a  narrow corridor  in front  of them.  Did this  lead  to </p>
<p class="calibre2">Mrs. Rossmeyer’s private quarters? </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">75 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The young couple entered the corridor and the door behind them locked itself. Their guide </p>
<p class="calibre2">suddenly began to sprint toward a door at the far end of the narrow hall. Before Nancy or </p>
<p class="calibre2">Ned could catch him, he had slipped through the door and pushed it shut. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ned tried to open it, but the door was locked. Then the light in the hallway went out and </p>
<p class="calibre2">they stood in total darkness! Together they groped their way to the other door. It, too, was </p>
<p class="calibre2">locked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy and Ned were trapped! </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">For  a  moment  the  young  people  stood  motionless,  thoughts  racing  through  their  minds. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly  Nancy  grabbed  her  friend’s  arm.  “Ned—the  keys!”  she  whispered.  “Let’s  try  all </p>
<p class="calibre2">those keys Dad gave us.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s the best idea you’ve had all night,” Ned murmured and pulled out his key ring. As </p>
<p class="calibre2">silently as possible, he tried one key after another. None of them fit! </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After he had fumbled with the last one, he sighed. “That’s it. Now let me have yours, and </p>
<p class="calibre2">hope we have better luck!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy handed him her set, and patiently the young man tried again. Finally one of the keys </p>
<p class="calibre2">went into the keyhole. Ned maneuvered it carefully, gritting his teeth. Tensely he turned it, </p>
<p class="calibre2">but  the  key  stuck!  Ned  jiggled  it  back  and  forth  and  then  turned  it  again.  This  time  it </p>
<p class="calibre2">worked! He opened the door a crack. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy and Ned were trapped! </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Wow!” he said, wiping his wet forehead in relief. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The  young  people  tiptoed  out  into  the  larger  hallway.  No  one  was  in  sight,  but  weird-</p>
<p class="calibre2">sounding Asiatic music drifted from the first floor. The couple listened for a moment. There </p>
<p class="calibre2">were no other sounds. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“What’s going on?” Ned asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I don’t know, but I mean to find out!” Nancy replied with determination. “It’s evident that </p>
<p class="calibre2">whatever is taking place, Mrs. Rossmeyer and Mr. Moto didn’t want us to see itl” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Carefully  Nancy  and  Ned  made  their  way  to  the  stairs.  They  saw  that  no  one  was  in  the </p>
<p class="calibre2">downstairs hall. Apparently all the guests had assembled in the living room. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The young sleuth stood in silence for a few moments, then motioned for Ned to follow her. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Cautiously the two sneaked down the steps to the first landing. From this vantage point they </p>
<p class="calibre2">could see everything clearly. Both gasped! </p>
<p class="calibre2">76 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ned whispered, “I can’t believe itl” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In  the  center  of  the  living  room  a  small  red  velvet  and  gold throne  had  been  set  up.  Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Rossmeyer was seated on it, a pearl tiara on her head. The electric lights had been turned </p>
<p class="calibre2">out, and hundreds of candles illuminated the strange scene. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The guests had put on long, white ceremonial robes over their evening clothes and formed a </p>
<p class="calibre2">long line. They began marching around Mrs. Rossmeyer. As each one approached her, he or </p>
<p class="calibre2">she bowed and then kneeled. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“What do you think this means?” Ned asked Nancy, a puzzled look on his face. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“It’s some kind of weird cult,” Nancy replied. “I think I know what it is. Tell you later.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Behind the woman seated on the throne stood a Japanese man. He held up a large, purple </p>
<p class="calibre2">velvet banner with a beautiful open pink shell painted on it. Attached to one corner was a </p>
<p class="calibre2">huge white pearl. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The thought flashed through Nancy’s mind, “Could this be the thirteenth pearl stolen from </p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr. Moto’s shop?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After the last guest had paid obeisance to Mrs. Rossmeyer, everyone began to dance to the </p>
<p class="calibre2">weird music. The performers moaned and cried and rolled their eyes as the woman on the </p>
<p class="calibre2">bed had done. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“This is crazy!” Ned declared. “We must call the police!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy nodded. “Let’s get out of here. I hope no one sees us.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The two young people tiptoed down the stairs as fast as they could. Nancy held her breath </p>
<p class="calibre2">and  kept  her  eyes  on  the  open  living room  door,  hoping  no  one  would notice  them  going </p>
<p class="calibre2">past. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">No  one  did,  and  when  they  reached  the  front  door,  the  uniformed  man  was  not  in  sight. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy and Ned breathed sighs of relief and slipped quietly out into the darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">They ran to Ned’s car, and he started it. As he drove along the rutted lane, Nancy put a hand </p>
<p class="calibre2">on his right arm. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Ned, before we notify the police, let’s go to the newspaper office!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
