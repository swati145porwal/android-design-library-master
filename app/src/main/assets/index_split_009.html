<h3 class="sigilNotInTOC">Identification </h3>

<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">WHEN Nancy arrived  at Tokyo  police headquarters  with her  father  and Mr. Mise,  she  was </p>
<p class="calibre2">taken  at  once  to  a  brightly  lighted  room.  In  the  center  of  it  stood  a  tall,  three-sectioned </p>
<p class="calibre2">Japanese screen. The young sleuth was told to sit down in a comfortable chair behind it. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">To her amazement, she found that she could look through the screen but was not visible to </p>
<p class="calibre2">anyone on the other side. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The  chief  explained  that  this  was  a  rather  recent  invention.  “Similar  screens  are  being </p>
<p class="calibre2">installed in many homes, where it is desirable for the owner to be able to look outside but </p>
<p class="calibre2">not to be observed by curious passersby. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He told the young sleuth that presently a woman would walk across the room. Nancy was to </p>
<p class="calibre2">observe her carefully and decide if she could identify her. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">39 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“She will not give us her name or tell us where she is from,” the officer explained. “But she </p>
<p class="calibre2">matched the description of the woman you gave  us the other day in connection with Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Rossmeyer, so we thought you might be able to help us.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He  left  the  room  and  she  waited eagerly for the  suspect  to appear.  In  a  few  minutes,  the </p>
<p class="calibre2">door opened again. A woman came in, looking around for anyone watching her. Seeing no </p>
<p class="calibre2">one, she walked toward a door on the other side. Nancy had no doubt in her mind that she </p>
<p class="calibre2">was indeed Rosina Caputti! </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The young detective had a wild desire to dash from behind the screen, confront Rosina, and </p>
<p class="calibre2">try to get a confession from her. She wanted to ask questions about Mr. Moto and World </p>
<p class="calibre2">Wide  Gems.  However,  she  knew  that  this  would  be  hopeless.  Mrs.  Caputti  would  deny </p>
<p class="calibre2">everything and refuse to talk. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The woman reached the far side of the room and was about to go out the door, when she </p>
<p class="calibre2">apparently  changed  her  mind.  With  an  evil  glint  in  her  eyes,  she  made  a  beeline  for  the </p>
<p class="calibre2">screen behind which Nancy was sitting. The young sleuth wondered what to do. Should she </p>
<p class="calibre2">play a cat and mouse game and dodge to the front of the screen? She had only a fraction of </p>
<p class="calibre2">a second to decide. Having identified Mrs. Caputti, she decided to stand her ground. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The next instant, the suspect hurried around to the back. She stopped short and stared at </p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy balefully. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“You little vixen!” she shouted, grabbing the girl by her hair. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy wrenched the woman’s hands away and exclaimed, “Leave me alone! It won’t do you </p>
<p class="calibre2">any good to harm me. You’re Rosina Caputti, and you’re likely to stay in prison!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The commotion brought the chief back into the room. “What is going on?” he shouted. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mrs. Caputti said, “This little busybody was spying on me. I won’t have it! Why did you tell </p>
<p class="calibre2">me to walk across this room?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy answered the question. “So I would be able to identify you.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At this Mrs. Caputti screamed and tried to get her hands on the girl again. “I never saw you </p>
<p class="calibre2">in my life!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy, who was athletic and strong, pinned the woman’s hands behind her, while the chief </p>
<p class="calibre2">called out in Japanese, apparently for help. Another officer appeared instantly. The two men </p>
<p class="calibre2">wrestled  with  Mrs.  Caputti,  who  was  fighting  them  like  a  tigress.  Finally  she  was  hustled </p>
<p class="calibre2">away, and the chief returned to Nancy. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“The woman is definitely Rosina Caputti,” the girl told him. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Thank you very much,” he said, bowing. “I did not know she would act like this,  but I am </p>
<p class="calibre2">glad you were able to identify her.” </p>
<p class="calibre2">40 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“You little vixen!” the woman shouted at Nancy. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He and Nancy walked into his office, where Mr. Drew and Mr. Mise were waiting. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy’s father asked, “What was all that screaming about?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The young detective gave him the details, then smiled. “I’m glad the chief rescued me. Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Caputti is much larger than I. I’m not sure I would have won the battle!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The officer grinned. “I would say you are very strong and agile yourself.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy and her father thanked the chief and said good-by. He replied, “Sayonara.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">When the three reached home, they found Mrs. Mise upset. Nancy sensed this at once and </p>
<p class="calibre2">asked, “While we were gone, did something unpleasant happen?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mrs. Mise nodded and replied, “A man, who would not give his name, phoned several times </p>
<p class="calibre2">asking for Mr. Drew and Nancy Drew.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“What did you tell him?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mrs. Mise smiled. “I said that no one by that name was here. And you were not. You were at </p>
<p class="calibre2">the police station.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Her  husband  said  that  was  very  clever,  and  she  went  on,  “The  man  made  threatening </p>
<p class="calibre2">remarks, but would not say who he was. Finally he became angry and said, ‘I will not phone </p>
<p class="calibre2">again, but tell Mr. Drew and that daughter of his that four plus nine still equals thirteen!’ ” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“It sounds as if he is getting desperate,” Mr. Drew commented. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“And scared,” Nancy added. “Maybe this unknown speaker planned to steal the thirteenth </p>
<p class="calibre2">pearl, but somebody else got there first. He thinks we know who it was and is trying to find </p>
<p class="calibre2">out.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr. Drew thought this was a shrewd guess. “Perhaps he’s one of the underworld characters, </p>
<p class="calibre2">but is being double-crossed by another member.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy  knew  Mrs.  Mise  was  convinced  that  she  and  her  father  were  in  grave  danger,  but </p>
<p class="calibre2">their hostess did not express her thoughts aloud. Instead, she said, “I think this evening we </p>
<p class="calibre2">should forget all about this mystery and have a good time. If my husband wishes to do so, I </p>
<p class="calibre2">suggest that we all go to the Kabuki Theater.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">41 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy and her father were delighted with this idea. They had an early supper, then drove to </p>
<p class="calibre2">the  huge  theater.  When  they  took  their  seats,  the  Drews  were  amazed  that  many  people </p>
<p class="calibre2">were  eating  or  walking  down  the  aisles,  even  though  the  first  play  had  already  begun.  To </p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy this seemed very rude. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr.  Mise  read  her  thoughts.  “These  plays  are  very  old,”  he  said,  “and  from  childhood  on </p>
<p class="calibre2">people get to know them. Many Japanese can recite them almost line for line, so by eating </p>
<p class="calibre2">or  walking  around,  they  really  do  not  miss  any  part  of  the  play  with  its  exquisite  poetic </p>
<p class="calibre2">lines.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Why are men in women’s parts?” Nancy inquired. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“This  goes  back  to  the  seventeenth  century  when  the  government  forbade  female  actors </p>
<p class="calibre2">and  dancers  on  stage.  The  men,  as  you  can  see,  are  heavily  made-up  and  whitened  to </p>
<p class="calibre2">resemble women.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“And  they  speak  in  falsetto  voices,”  Nancy  added,  then  turned  her  attention  to  the  play </p>
<p class="calibre2">again. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">She noticed that when a husband and wife returned to their home, the man walked up to </p>
<p class="calibre2">the door, took his sandals off with the toes heading toward the door, and walked in. His wife </p>
<p class="calibre2">paused, turned around, and removed her shoes, leaving them pointing outward. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy  did  not  mention  this  until  they  were  on  their  way  home.  Then  she  asked  what  it </p>
<p class="calibre2">meant. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mrs.  Mise  told  her  that  in  ancient  Japanese  custom,  the  man  was  the  sole  owner  of  his </p>
<p class="calibre2">house.  Everyone  else  was  a  guest,  even  his  wife.  For  this  reason,  she  had  to  point  her </p>
<p class="calibre2">sandals outward, which was the proper position to leave. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Drews’ evening had been most enjoyable. Before going to bed, Mrs. Mise offered their </p>
<p class="calibre2">American  friends  tea.  She  appeared  a  few  minutes  later  with  a  large  tray.  On  it  were  the </p>
<p class="calibre2">necessary  utensils:  a  pot  of  steaming hot  water,  pottery tea bowls,  a  tea  container,  and  a </p>
<p class="calibre2">bamboo whisk and dipper. There was also a plate of delicious little bean and sugar cakes. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Tea was brought to Japan from China in the eighth century,” explained Mrs. Mise while she </p>
<p class="calibre2">spooned  the  green  powder  into  the  bowls.  “It  was  found  to  have  consoling,  calming,  and </p>
<p class="calibre2">soothing powers, and the masters of the Zen religion made a ritual out of its drinking.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">She spooned in just enough water to cover the bottom of the bowls. Then she whirled the </p>
<p class="calibre2">wisk between her hands to make the mixture frothy before handing the bowls to the Drews. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“This is the manner in which tea is prepared during the tea ceremony,” Mrs. Mise went on. </p>
<p class="calibre2">“Everyone sits on the floor on the backs of his heels, with toes crossed and knees together, </p>
<p class="calibre2">and all bow low each time before eating or drinking. The hostess has carefully learned the </p>
<p class="calibre2">skills of the ceremony in the form sanctified by a great tea master, and her movements are </p>
<p class="calibre2">very precise.” </p>
<p class="calibre2">42 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">They drank the thick, opaque liquid. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“This is good,” Nancy said, “but it is slightly bitter.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mrs. Mise smiled. “The tea ceremony involves deep, true friendship. It is said that love of all </p>
<p class="calibre2">humanity is in the tea, not in coffee or any other drink, only in Japanese green tea.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“It is also guaranteed to help you sleep, in case you have any trouble,” Mr. Mise added. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">But Nancy  had  no problem falling  asleep.  She had had  a full  and  exciting  day.  She did not </p>
<p class="calibre2">know how long she had been in bed when she heard her name called softly. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At  first  the  girl  was  too  sleepy  to  pay  attention,  but  after  “Nancy,  Nancy,  Nancy!”  was </p>
<p class="calibre2">repeated several times, she became wide awake. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Who are you?” she asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">There  was  no  answer  to  her  question,  but  the  speaker  demanded,  “Have  the  prisoner </p>
<p class="calibre2">released from jail and go home!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
