<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">BEFORE  the  police  dog  could  attack  Nancy  and  Ned,  they  bounded  into  the  living  room, </p>
<p class="calibre2">jumped over the back of a sofa that stood cater-cornered to the wall, and dropped to the </p>
<p class="calibre2">floor. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The  furious  animal  jumped  onto  the  sofa  and  snarled  at  them.  He  did  not  pounce  on  the </p>
<p class="calibre2">couple, however, apparently afraid of being caught in the narrow enclosure. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Help! Help!” Nancy and Ned shouted at the top of their lungs. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly the man at the front door called out, “This is your last warning!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The big dog, meanwhile, had jumped off the sofa and tried to crawl underneath it in order </p>
<p class="calibre2">to  get  at  Nancy  and  Ned.  He  succeeded  only  partway,  but  kept  snarling  at  the  trapped </p>
<p class="calibre2">couple. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Help!” Nancy cried out again. “But be careful! There’s a vicious dog in here!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Just  then  her  father  came  running  down  the  stairway  in  his  bathrobe  and  slippers.  He </p>
<p class="calibre2">carried  a  stout  cane.  As  Mr.  Drew  reached  the  last  step,  the  stranger,  who  stood  in  the </p>
<p class="calibre2">doorway, commanded, “Don’t interfere!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy’s  father  paid  no  attention.  He  turned  on  the  ceiling  light  in  the  living  room  and </p>
<p class="calibre2">approached the sofa. At the same moment, Hannah Gruen appeared from the kitchen, also </p>
<p class="calibre2">wearing  a  bathrobe  and  slippers.  In  one  hand  she  held  a  broom,  in  the  other  a  bucket  of </p>
<p class="calibre2">water. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">70 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy suddenly remembered her pet. Frantically she called out, “Where’s Togo?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Up in your room waiting for you,” Hannah replied. “I shut the door, so he can’t get out.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The  unfriendly  German  shepherd  had  started  to  back  out  from  under  the  couch.  Hannah </p>
<p class="calibre2">whacked  him  with  the  broom,  and  as  soon  as  the  dog’s  head  appeared,  she  threw  the </p>
<p class="calibre2">bucket of water into his face. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The animal yelped in pain from the whacks, and his owner whistled for him. Willingly, the </p>
<p class="calibre2">defeated attacker ran from the house. Ned pushed the sofa forward and hurried after him </p>
<p class="calibre2">to the door. The visitors had already left in a car. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The lock had been broken, but with Mr. Drew’s help, Ned managed to nail it shut. Then they </p>
<p class="calibre2">pushed the sofa back into place. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the meantime, Nancy had emerged from her hiding place and thanked Hannah for taking </p>
<p class="calibre2">care of Togo, who was barking wildly upstairs. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Shouldn’t we report this to the police?” Nancy asked her father. “The dog might be a clue </p>
<p class="calibre2">to who the stranger was.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes, that’s a good idea. Call right away.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy spoke to the officer on duty and asked if he had a record of large German shepherds </p>
<p class="calibre2">owned by the residents of River Heights. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes, we do have a list from the license bureau. I’ll phone each owner and find out where </p>
<p class="calibre2">his  dog  has  been,”  he  promised.  Twenty  minutes  later  he  called  back.  “Every  German </p>
<p class="calibre2">shepherd in town was indoors during the time when the vicious dog entered your home,” </p>
<p class="calibre2">he reported. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy thanked the officer and decided that “the voice” and the vicious dog had come from </p>
<p class="calibre2">out of town. She mentioned this to her father, and she remarked, “The stranger certainly is </p>
<p class="calibre2">well-protected.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Late the next afternoon she and Ned dressed for Moto’s farewell party. Since Nancy did not </p>
<p class="calibre2">know where Mrs. Rossmeyer’s house was, she decided to call Mr. Kikichi. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Mrs. Rossmeyer is at home?” he inquired, amazed. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I guess so,” Nancy replied. “She invited me to come and see her. Have you heard from Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Moto?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“No.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">This answer puzzled Nancy, but she did not tell Mr. Kikichi that the party was supposed to </p>
<p class="calibre2">be in his friend’s honor. She got directions and thanked the man. </p>
<p class="calibre2">71 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">On  the  way  to  Mrs.  Rossmeyer’s,  Nancy  and  Ned  discussed  the  situation.  “It’s  over  my </p>
<p class="calibre2">head,” Ned confessed. “Tell me your thoughts.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“There is a possibility Mr. Moto has not been kidnapped, but instead has chosen to go into </p>
<p class="calibre2">hiding,” Nancy said, but she did not sound convincing. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“But if this is so, why hasn’t Mr. Kikichi been invited to the party?” Ned asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Not only that,” Nancy said, “But just before Mr. Moto disappeared, he told us that he had </p>
<p class="calibre2">never met Mrs. Rossmeyer. If the party is really in his honor, she must have been introduced </p>
<p class="calibre2">to him after that.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ned added, “And perhaps he told her about you. That’s why you were invited.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Could be,” Nancy agreed thoughtfully. “But I still think all this is very strange.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I  do,  too,” Ned  said. “And  so  does  your father. He  gave  me  a bunch  of keys  in  case Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Rossmeyer is in league with the crooks and tries to lock us up in her estate.” He pulled out </p>
<p class="calibre2">two  rings  with  master  keys  on  them.  “You  take  one,  and  I’ll  take  the  other.  Your  Dad  felt </p>
<p class="calibre2">they might come in handy.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Good  idea.”  Nancy  smiled  and  put  the  key  ring  into  her  evening  bag.  “Dad  thinks  of </p>
<p class="calibre2">everything to protect me.” She smiled at her companion. “And you do pretty well yourself at </p>
<p class="calibre2">the  same  job.”  She  quickly  added,  to  cover  any  embarrassment  he  might  feel,  “I’m </p>
<p class="calibre2">suspicious  of  those  numbers  we  were  told  to  use  for  identification.  I  wonder  what  it’s </p>
<p class="calibre2">about.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m with you.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Suppose I say ‘number twelve and escort’ to the doorman? I’d like to avoid thirteen.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s a good idea,” Ned agreed. “And please stay close to me. Together we’ll be safer if </p>
<p class="calibre2">any funny business is going on.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">It was almost dark when they reached the road to which Mr. Kikichi had directed them. It </p>
<p class="calibre2">was narrow, rutted, and looked like a lane through the woods, rather than the entrance to </p>
<p class="calibre2">an elegant estate. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As  they  drove  along,  Ned  remarked,  “Mrs.  Rossmeyer  must  like  privacy,  unless  Kikichi  is </p>
<p class="calibre2">sending us in the wrong direction.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Just  then,  however,  the  house  came  into  view.  Many  cars  were  parked  near  the  brightly </p>
<p class="calibre2">lighted entrance. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“He didn’t.” Nancy chuckled. “And there’s really a party going on. Now I feel better.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">72 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“So do I,” Ned said as he positioned his car in such a fashion that they could make a quick </p>
<p class="calibre2">getaway if necessary. Then the couple walked up to the house. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">They could see people through the windows and paused to look at them. About half were </p>
<p class="calibre2">American, the other half Asiatic. All wore evening clothes, but many of the outfits were so </p>
<p class="calibre2">outlandish  that  Ned  whispered,  “They’re  dressed  as  if  they  were  going  to  a  Halloween </p>
<p class="calibre2">party.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“And look at the jewelryl There must be tons of it!” Nancy said. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">She was astonished at the gems the women were wearing. After studying necklaces, Nancy </p>
<p class="calibre2">suddenly  realized  that  so  far  as  she  could  judge  from  the  distance,  every  one  contained </p>
<p class="calibre2">twenty-five pearls. Like Mrs. Rossmeyer’s stolen piece, there was a large center pearl with </p>
<p class="calibre2">twelve smaller ones on each side. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The  center  pearl  differed  with  each  necklace.  Some  were  white,  others  gray,  many  were </p>
<p class="calibre2">blue, a few were rose-colored, and three of them were black. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy  pointed  out  her  discovery  to  Ned.  “There  certainly  must  be  some  significance  to </p>
<p class="calibre2">that,” she said in a barely audible voice. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Perhaps we shouldn’t go in,” Ned suggested. “How about reporting the party to the police? </p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, the man who called you said it was a surprise. Well, I’d say it is!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy nodded but insisted they go in. “I have a feeling we’re on the verge of making a big </p>
<p class="calibre2">discovery, and I don’t want to back out now.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He  finally  agreed,  and  the  two  went  up  a  few  steps  to  a  large,  open  veranda.  From  there </p>
<p class="calibre2">they walked to the front door. It was opened by a man in a red velvet uniform. He looked at </p>
<p class="calibre2">the couple and put out an arm as if to stop them. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">To allay any suspicion on his part, Nancy smiled and said, “I am number twelve and this is </p>
<p class="calibre2">my escort.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The  doorman  stared  at  her,  and  she  and  Ned  held  their  breaths,  wondering  what  would </p>
<p class="calibre2">happen next. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
