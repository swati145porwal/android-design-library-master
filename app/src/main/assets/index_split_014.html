<h3 class="sigilNotInTOC">The Trap </h3>

<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">NANCY  was  so  shocked  at  seeing  the  beautiful  necklace  taken  from  her  sleeve  that  for  a </p>
<p class="calibre2">moment she was speechless. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Her father came to her defense. “This is ridiculous. My daughter certainly does not own that </p>
<p class="calibre2">and did not take it from anyone.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The officer asked how she could explain its presence in her sleeve. “You had better come up </p>
<p class="calibre2">with a good story, or I will have to take you to headquarters!” he said sternly. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I have already spoken to the chief about a case I’m working on involving stolen jewelry,” </p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy said. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The officer raised his eyebrows in amazement. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“It started in the United States,” the girl detective went on. “A valuable necklace was stolen </p>
<p class="calibre2">from  a  jeweler  in  my  hometown  just  before  the  jeweler  mysteriously  disappeared.  My </p>
<p class="calibre2">father and I came here to investigate because several leads pointed to Japan. We hope to </p>
<p class="calibre2">locate the stolen piece and also the thief.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Is it this necklace?” the officer asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“No. But I saw a very suspicious man take a string of pearls from a woman. When I accused </p>
<p class="calibre2">him,  he denied  it.  Since he  didn’t  have  it  on his person,  we  couldn’t prove  it,  and  he  left. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Then  other  people  complained  about  having  their  jewelry  stolen.  I  know  he  framed  me </p>
<p class="calibre2">before slipping out so I could not pursue him any longer!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy gave more details of the case, and the young officer did not know how to proceed. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Since evidence was found on her person, could he legally let her go? </p>
<p class="calibre2">58 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">By this time Mr. and Mrs. Mise had come up to Nancy and her father and asked what the </p>
<p class="calibre2">trouble  was.  They  knew  the  officer.  As  soon  as  they  heard  what  had  happened,  both </p>
<p class="calibre2">vouched for Nancy, saying the accusation was unjust. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The  policeman  finally  agreed  to  release  Nancy  into  the  Mises’  custody  if  they  would </p>
<p class="calibre2">guarantee her appearance in court if she were called. Mr. Mise promised. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The  commotion  over the  jewelry thefts  had  ruined  the  wedding  reception.  Nancy  and her </p>
<p class="calibre2">father went to find the bride and groom and their parents, but all of them had left. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I  certainly  feel  sorry  for  them,”  Nancy  declared.  “It  should  have  been  such  a  happy </p>
<p class="calibre2">occasion. To have something like this happen will be an unfortunate memory for them.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr. Drew and the Mises agreed. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I see they have opened the doors once more,” Mr. Mise said. “I suppose they did not find </p>
<p class="calibre2">the thief and his accomplice. Evidently they escaped before the doors were closed. We may </p>
<p class="calibre2">as well go home ourselves now.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He kept in close touch with the police for the next few hours, but learned nothing helpful. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Had the reception thieves left the country, or was Caputti still in Japan? </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mrs. Mise remarked, “As long as Mrs. Caputti is in jail, I doubt that her husband would leave </p>
<p class="calibre2">town.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“He might,” Mr. Drew said. “Benny’s a very cruel man.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The following morning Nancy asked Mr. Mise if he would take her and her father back to the </p>
<p class="calibre2">World Wide Gems offices to talk to Mr. Kampura about the case. He was not in, and the only </p>
<p class="calibre2">person available was Mr. Hashi, the local manager. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">When  questioned  by  the  Drews  about  the  various  jewel  thefts,  he  said  he  knew  nothing </p>
<p class="calibre2">about them. Nancy asked him if he was aware that World Wide Gems was under suspicion. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, no! We are a reputable organization!” he replied. “Where did you hear such a rumor?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy gave no details but thought she detected a frown on the man’s face. Other than that, </p>
<p class="calibre2">he  showed  no  sign  of  being  disturbed.  Instead,  he  insisted  on  the  fine  reputation  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre2">company and that it was considered the finest jewelry wholesaler in the world. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“That must be of great satisfaction to you and the other executives,” Nancy said. “Actually </p>
<p class="calibre2">we were told that the president and other top of ficials are not directly involved.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr.  Hashi  was  annoyed.  He  took  this  remark  as  an  inference  that  he  might  be  under </p>
<p class="calibre2">suspicion, not being a top official himself. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">59 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“If  you  are  implying  that  I  am  dishonest,  I  wish  to  inform  you  that  my  integrity has  never </p>
<p class="calibre2">been questioned. Now I must say good-by to you,” he said coldly. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He  arose,  then  bowed  stiffly  and  held  this  position  until  the  callers  had  left  his  office.  As </p>
<p class="calibre2">they  were  walking  down  the  hallway,  the  visitors  came  face  to  face  with  Mr.  Taro,  the </p>
<p class="calibre2">president of the company. He wished them a pleasant morning and kept on going. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy stopped him. “Mr. Taro,” she said, “we came to ask if any jewelry has been offered to </p>
<p class="calibre2">you by a Mr. Caputti or a Mr. Slate.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“No,  neither  one  of  them  has  been  here,”  the  man  replied.  “In  fact,  recently  no  one  has </p>
<p class="calibre2">come to me with anything valuable to sell.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Thank you,” Nancy said, and her group continued toward the elevator. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly her father turned around and hurried back to Mr. Taro. “Pardon me,” he said to </p>
<p class="calibre2">the president, “but it is important for me as a lawyer to know whether you, as head of this </p>
<p class="calibre2">company,  are  aware  of  the  fact  that  World  Wide  Gems  is  presently  under  suspicion  of </p>
<p class="calibre2">underhanded dealings.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr.  Taro  laughed.  “It  is  impossible.  You  heard  a  rumor  that  is  absolutely  not  true.”  With </p>
<p class="calibre2">that, he hurried on. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr.  Drew  joined  Nancy  and  Mr.  Mise  in  front  of  the  elevator.  Before  it  arrived,  a  young </p>
<p class="calibre2">Japanese woman, who evidently worked for World Wide Gems, approached them. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Follow me,” she said to Nancy in a low voice. “I can tell you something importantl” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy  signaled  to  her  father  to  watch  where  they  were  going  in  case  of  foul  play,  then </p>
<p class="calibre2">walked quickly after the woman to a ladies restroom. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">When  the  door  was  closed  behind  them,  the  stranger  said,  “I  cannot  stay  away  from  my </p>
<p class="calibre2">desk  very  long  or  my  boss  will  be  suspicious.  I  am  Mr.  Taro’s  secretary,  and  I  am  worried </p>
<p class="calibre2">about him. He is an honest man, but recently he has become suspicious of certain officials in </p>
<p class="calibre2">the company. He is afraid that they are carrying on some dishonest schemes in regard to the </p>
<p class="calibre2">purchase of jewelry.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy nodded. “He probably didn’t want to admit it to us. How did you find out about it?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I overheard a conversation on his private telephone line. I do not know to whom he was </p>
<p class="calibre2">speaking, but the other person said, ”Yes, I received a warning note that said four plus nine </p>
<p class="calibre2">equals thirteen.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy was startled. The look  on her face prompted the young woman to ask whether she </p>
<p class="calibre2">knew what it meant. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">60 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I  have  an  idea  it  stands  for  danger,”  Nancy  replied,  but  did  not  mention  having  received </p>
<p class="calibre2">several similar warnings. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I  know  you  are  a  detective,”  the  Japanese  woman  went  on.  “I  spent  some  time  in  your </p>
<p class="calibre2">country and read about you. When I overheard your name today, I felt I could trust you. I </p>
<p class="calibre2">am so worried about Mr. Taro. Perhaps you can help him. He is a wonderful person, and I do </p>
<p class="calibre2">not wish to have any harm come to him.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m glad you told me,” Nancy said. “I’ll do my best.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Thank you,” the girl said. “Now I must go.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">She  opened  the  door  and  hurried  out  quickly.  Nancy  waited  several  seconds  before </p>
<p class="calibre2">following her, so that no one in the hallway would suspect that they had been talking. Then </p>
<p class="calibre2">she joined her father and Mr. Mise again. They all went down and walked into the street. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">When  they arrived home  Nancy told  her  story  so  that Mrs. Mise  could hear  it,  too.  When </p>
<p class="calibre2">she was finished, everyone was shocked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“This  is  a  most  complicated  affair,”  Mrs.  Mise  said.  “Those  jewel  thieves  are  dreadful </p>
<p class="calibre2">people!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I  have  a  feeling  that  top  officials  at  World  Wide  Gems  who  are  not  involved  with  the </p>
<p class="calibre2">underworld might be in grave danger. They must have found out certain things and are now </p>
<p class="calibre2">being threatened.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“And  the  criminals  would  stop  at  nothing  to  gain  their  ends,”  Mr.  Mise  added.  “I  am  so </p>
<p class="calibre2">worried about both of you.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The  Drews  did  not  feel  comfortable  either,  but  said  that  they  had  been  in  precarious </p>
<p class="calibre2">situations before and never quit when they were hot on the trail of wrongdoers. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’d like very much to see a list of all people working for World Wide Gems,” she added. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr. Mise jumped up from his chair. “It just occurred to me that I have one. I own a small </p>
<p class="calibre2">amount of stock in the company. A list came with the annual report. However, it gives only </p>
<p class="calibre2">the names of officers.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s enough to start with,” Nancy said, and he went to get it. Nancy and her father read </p>
<p class="calibre2">the names of the many vice presidents. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly the girl exclaimed, “Look! I can’t believe it!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Don’t tell me Mr. Caputti is an executive of World Wide Gems,” her father teased. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“No, but wait until you hear who is ! Mrs. Tanya Rossmeyer!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">61 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr. Drew stared at her. “You’re kidding!” I had no idea that she was active in any business.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“She certainly doesn’t act like a business woman,” Nancy added, “traveling from one place </p>
<p class="calibre2">to another without telling anyone her schedule.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s true,” her father agreed. “On the other hand, with her love and knowledge of gems, </p>
<p class="calibre2">she would be qualified.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“She  had  some  quite  valuable  jewelry  stolen,”  Nancy  mused.  “Perhaps  she  was  allowing </p>
<p class="calibre2">herself to be robbed by a confederate of the company as a cover up! Dad, Mrs. Rossmeyer </p>
<p class="calibre2">could be in league with the thieves at World Wide Gems!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mrs. Mise had sat down in one corner and started to read the morning paper. Suddenly she </p>
<p class="calibre2">cried out, “Here is an amazing article!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“What does it say?” Nancy asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“It is a report from Rome that states that Mrs. Tanya Rossmeyer, while attending a dinner, </p>
<p class="calibre2">was robbed of a priceless necklacel” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
