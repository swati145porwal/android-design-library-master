<h3 class="sigilNotInTOC">Shocking News </h3>

<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“MR.  DREWRY”  reported  to  Nancy  that  his  secretary,  Miss  Hanson,  had  checked  with </p>
<p class="calibre2">various other airlines that Mr. Moto might have taken to Japan. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“None of them had any record of a flight booked in his name,” he said. “I also got word on </p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr. Kikichi. As far as she could ascertain, he’s in the United States legally, and there were </p>
<p class="calibre2">never any charges against him.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Thank you for your report, Mr. Campbell Drewry,” Nancy said with an impish grin as they </p>
<p class="calibre2">walked toward the boarding gate. Mr. Drew squeezed his daughter’s left arm affectionately. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“You’re welcome. And now we’d better go. Our flight is ready.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The  Drews  followed  a  group  of  passengers  onto  the  large  jet  and  took  their  seats.  Nancy </p>
<p class="calibre2">was in trigued by the dainty hostesses in native kimonos. Before the first meal was served, </p>
<p class="calibre2">the young women brought in steaming hot towels for the passengers to wash their hands </p>
<p class="calibre2">with. When the trays of food were set before them, the Drews looked at them, wondering </p>
<p class="calibre2">how they would enjoy the exotic dishes. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy remarked politely, “Isn’t that an attractive color arrangement?” The tray contained a </p>
<p class="calibre2">bouquet of green parsley in a small vase. Next to it was a tiny platter with pinkish raw fish. </p>
<p class="calibre2">21 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">White boiled rice and a dish of broiled eel were alongside it. A pot of green tea was served, </p>
<p class="calibre2">and dessert consisted of a combination of fresh apricots and peaches. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr. Kampura was seated at the very front of the plane near the exit door. Once Mr. Drew </p>
<p class="calibre2">walked up close to him and talked to the hostess, but he kept his eyes on the Japanese man </p>
<p class="calibre2">all the while. Kampura was speaking to the man sitting next to him, but their conversation </p>
<p class="calibre2">was unintelligible to the lawyer. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">When they arrived at their destination many hours later, Mr. Kampura was the first to get </p>
<p class="calibre2">off  the  plane.  Nancy  and  her  father  tried  to  follow  him,  but  with  most  of  the  passengers </p>
<p class="calibre2">standing in the aisle, it was impossible. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Drews claimed their baggage and walked out into the lobby.  They noticed a Japanese </p>
<p class="calibre2">couple who were waiting near an exit. The man looked so much like Professor Mise in River </p>
<p class="calibre2">Heights that Nancy and her father felt he must be his brother. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Americans walked up to the couple. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Pardon me, but are you Mr. and Mrs. Mise?” Nancy asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The man smiled. “Ah, yes. And you are Mr. Drew and Miss Nancy Drew?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes, we are,” the lawyer replied. “We’re delighted that you speak English. Unfortunately, </p>
<p class="calibre2">we have never learned your language.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The  couple  bowed  low  to  the  visitors,  and  Mr.  Mise  said,  “You  make  us  very  happy  by </p>
<p class="calibre2">visiting us. Perhaps you will pick up some Japanese phrases while you are here.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’d like to ” said Nancy. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr.  Mise  took  her  suitcase,  and  the  Drews  followed  their  hosts  outside  to  a  waiting  car. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy could not resist taking a peek at the tires. They did not have the Rising Sun insignia on </p>
<p class="calibre2">them. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As  Mr.  Mise  drove  through  the  city,  Nancy  and  her  father  commented  how  much  it </p>
<p class="calibre2">resembled  an  American  metropolis,  despite  the  sprinkling  of  one-story  brown  wooden </p>
<p class="calibre2">houses, which served as a small reminder of “Old Japan ” Most of the people wore Western </p>
<p class="calibre2">dress, and the streets were literally teeming with the city’s ten million inhabitants. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr. Mise came to an open area with a large marketplace and stopped the car. “Would you </p>
<p class="calibre2">like to get out and walk around?” he asked. “This is one of our flower markets. We Japanese </p>
<p class="calibre2">like  our  gardens  to  be  all  green  because  we  think  it  induces  tranquility  and  rest.  But  we </p>
<p class="calibre2">enjoy flowers in the house.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Part of the area was filled with chrysanthemums of every conceivable color and size. These </p>
<p class="calibre2">flowers were not yet in full season, and apparently they had been forced. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">22 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr. Drew spoke up. “May I purchase some for you, Mrs. Mise?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The woman smiled and bowed. Later Nancy learned that it was considered bad manners for </p>
<p class="calibre2">a Japanese to refuse a gift, which was called a presento. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yellow  chrysanthemums  were  bought,  then  the  journey  proceeded  to  the  Mises’  home, </p>
<p class="calibre2">which  was  several  miles  out  of  town.  It  proved  to  be  a  beautiful  place  and  was  entirely </p>
<p class="calibre2">concealed  from  the  road  by  trees  and  bushes.  A  gardener  on  a  step  ladder  was  pulling </p>
<p class="calibre2">needles from a pine tree. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mrs.  Mise  explained  why.  “Japanese do not  care  for  bushy  gardens.  We  like  to be  able  to </p>
<p class="calibre2">look through the foliage, so a certain number of needles are pulled out.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">They rode to the house. Mrs. Mise, Nancy, and Mr. Drew alighted, while Mr. Mise took the </p>
<p class="calibre2">car  to  the  garage.  The  house  was  designed  in  true  Japanese  style,  with  sliding  panels  for </p>
<p class="calibre2">walls. The panels could be opened easily to give more space. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mrs. Mise said with a smile, “We do not sit on the floor to eat, as many of our countrymen </p>
<p class="calibre2">do. We prefer the type of table and chair that you have in your country.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy asked if the couple slept on the floor, as was the custom, and was told that in their </p>
<p class="calibre2">second  floor  bedrooms  there  was  American  furniture.  Mrs.  Mise  led  the  Drews  to  their </p>
<p class="calibre2">rooms, and while the visitors were unpacking clothes, she arranged the chrysanthemums in </p>
<p class="calibre2">a typical Japanese pattern. At the top of the bouquet was one flower, surrounded by leaves. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Below it was another, and near the rim of the vase was a third. The arrangement was very </p>
<p class="calibre2">artistic. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">When Nancy and her father came downstairs and noticed the beautiful bouquet, Mrs. Mise </p>
<p class="calibre2">explained that the top flower represented Heaven, the middle one Man, and the lowest one </p>
<p class="calibre2">Earth. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At dinner, which was served by a dainty young woman in Japanese costume, conversation </p>
<p class="calibre2">turned to the main reason for the Drews’ visit. The stolen necklace was not mentioned, but </p>
<p class="calibre2">Mrs. Rossmeyer was. The Mises had heard of her through the press, but had never seen the </p>
<p class="calibre2">woman. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“We are interested in an organization called World Wide Gems,” Mr. Drew told them. “Do </p>
<p class="calibre2">you happen to know a Mr. Kampura, who is connected with the company?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr.  Mise  said,  “I  have  met  the  man  but  do  not  know  him  well.  World  Wide  Gems  has  its </p>
<p class="calibre2">main office in Tokyo, but the many salesmen are scattered throughout the world.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy asked, “Would it be possible for us to meet Mr. Kampura?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr. Mise thought this could be arranged. He would telephone in the morning to find out. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">23 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Now  the  Drews  told  the  Mises  about  the  missing  jeweler,  Mr.  Moto.  “We  heard  from  his </p>
<p class="calibre2">friend, Mr. Kikichi, that he had gone to Japan,” Nancy explained. “But none of the airlines </p>
<p class="calibre2">we asked had issued a ticket to him. We think he might have been kidnapped.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, no!” Mrs. Mise said. “What are you going to do?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“He has a brother in Tokyo,” Nancy said, “Tetsuo Moto. I would like to find out if Tetsuo has </p>
<p class="calibre2">heard from him.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr. Mise brought out a telephone directory to find Tetsuo’s number. There was a listing, but </p>
<p class="calibre2">when he called up, he was told that the number had been disconnected because the man </p>
<p class="calibre2">had moved. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Shall  I  get  in  touch  with  the  police  and  explain  the  situation?”  Mr.  Mise  asked.  “Perhaps </p>
<p class="calibre2">they can trace Tetsuo Moto for you.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“That would be a good idea,” Mr. Drew said, and the host put in the call. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“The officers will let me know if they can find him,” he reported after a short conversation. </p>
<p class="calibre2">“And now it is late. Any time you wish to go to bed, do tell us. We want you to feel at home </p>
<p class="calibre2">while you are here. Please do not hesitate to ask us for anything you may desire.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr. Drew said, “You are very thoughtful. Nancy and I are tired and would appreciate getting </p>
<p class="calibre2">some sleep. Once more I want to thank you for inviting us here.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy spoke up. “Your brother, the professor, and his wife are wonderful people. I can see </p>
<p class="calibre2">that you are exactly like them.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone said good-night and went to his room. The following morning when Nancy came </p>
<p class="calibre2">to breakfast she found an envelope alongside her plate. Her name was printed on it in large, </p>
<p class="calibre2">bold letters. Inside was a single sheet of writing paper containing the following equation:4 + </p>
<p class="calibre2">9 = 13 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Puzzled, Nancy handed the note to Mr. Mise and asked if he knew what it meant. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A  worried  expression  spread  over  his  face.  “Four  is  shi  in  Japanese,  which  also  stands  for </p>
<p class="calibre2">death. Nine is ku, which translates to suffering in pain. Thirteen has no double meaning.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“It does to me,” Nancy said slowly. “I’m sure it refers to the thirteenth pearl.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I do not understand,” Mr. Mise said. “What is the thirteenth pearl?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">24 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Danger!”  Mr.  Drew  said  tensely,  then  told  the  Mises  about  Mrs.  Rossmeyer’s  stolen </p>
<p class="calibre2">necklace. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">When he finished,  their host frowned.  “Do  you  think  the  stolen  thirteenth  pearl  has  been </p>
<p class="calibre2">brought to this country?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s what we’re trying to find out. We believe that Mr. Kampura might be mixed up in </p>
<p class="calibre2">this somehow, and we are here to investigate.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mrs. Mise had a suggestion. “When you go to Mr. Kampura’s office, Nancy should dress like </p>
<p class="calibre2">a Japanese girl. Then she will not be recognized if someone is following you.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr. Mise thought this was a wise idea. He also felt that he should go with Nancy, while Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Drew and his wife should leave later and take a different route. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">An appointment with Mr. Kampura had been made for 11:00 o’clock. This left plenty of time </p>
<p class="calibre2">for Mrs. Mise to disguise Nancy. The woman said she had been a dancer and knew all about </p>
<p class="calibre2">make-up. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I am sure I can make you look like a Japanese girl.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">First she rubbed white salve on Nancy’s face and covered it with powder to lighten her sun-</p>
<p class="calibre2">tanned skin. Then she darkened and upturned Nancy’s eyebrows and put a black wig on her </p>
<p class="calibre2">head. It had a tiny lotus blossom on one side. She was given a rosebud-type mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Finally Mrs. Mise brought out a pretty but subdued kimono, an obi, a pair of white stockings, </p>
<p class="calibre2">and sandals. When the young detective was ready, she went downstairs. Her father and Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Mise were astounded at the change in her appearance. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“It’s a perfect disguise!” Mr. Mise marveled. “I would never recognize you.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr. Drew joked about his lovely little Japanese daughter. Then she and Mr. Mise set off in </p>
<p class="calibre2">his car. They arrived at the offices of World Wide Gems about ten minutes earlier than Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Drew and Mrs. Mise. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr. Kampura had a very attractive office furnished partly in Japanese and partly in Western </p>
<p class="calibre2">style. Nancy bowed low when she was introduced, but on purpose her name was so slurred </p>
<p class="calibre2">that no one could understand it. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Just then a man walked into the room and stopped short when he saw the visitors. “So sorry </p>
<p class="calibre2">to interrupt,” he said with a smile. “I was not aware that you had guests.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr. Kampura seemed uncomfortable at the interruption. “This is Mr. Taro, the president of </p>
<p class="calibre2">our organization,” he introduced the pleasant-looking Japanese man. “May I present—” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">But  Mr.  Taro,  not  wishing  to  disturb  the  meeting,  had  already  turned  and  slipped  out  the </p>
<p class="calibre2">door. Nancy breathed a muted sigh of relief, since she did not want her name repeated. </p>
<p class="calibre2">25 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Nancy, it’s a perfect disguise!” Mr. Mise exclaimed. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“What can I do for you?” Mr. Kampura asked, impatience showing in his voice. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I will be brief,” Mr. Drew replied, realizing that Mr. Kampura did not wish his callers to stay </p>
<p class="calibre2">long.  “I  am  a  lawyer  in  the  United  States,  and  it  is  important  that  I  find  Mrs.  Tanya </p>
<p class="calibre2">Rossmeyer. I understand she is probably in this country buying jewelry.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr. Kampura said nothing, so Mr. Drew went on, “It is essential that I discuss a legal matter </p>
<p class="calibre2">with her. I have been told that she has purchased a good bit of jewelry from your company. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Can you tell me where she is?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">There was a long pause, then Mr. Kampura said, “Yes, I know of Mrs. Rossmeyer. She was a </p>
<p class="calibre2">client of ours. But I believe she was in Europe recently and met a tragic deathl” </p>
