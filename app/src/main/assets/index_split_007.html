<h3 class="sigilNotInTOC">Chase in the Park </h3>

<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">31 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">THERE were tense and fearful moments as the plane descended at a quick rate toward the </p>
<p class="calibre2">sea. All passengers were strapped in and put their heads in their laps, awaiting the crash. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">But the pilot was skillful. He managed to touch the water lightly, then lifted the craft so it </p>
<p class="calibre2">bounced along the shoreline like a stone being tossed across the water. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He finally managed to land safely, and no one was injured. Relieved, the passengers aboard </p>
<p class="calibre2">began to talk excitedly. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr. and Mrs. Mise congratulated Nancy and her father for having remained so calm. “I can </p>
<p class="calibre2">see that you are experienced travelers,” Mr. Mise said as the seaplane floated tranquilly to a </p>
<p class="calibre2">dock. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Good thing we didn’t crash,” Mr. Drew said, “or the pearl-making oysters here would have </p>
<p class="calibre2">gotten a dreadful scare!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The others laughed, then Mr. Mise asked the pilot what had gone wrong and translated the </p>
<p class="calibre2">answer. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“He feels that someone tampered with the engines. After a complete examination, he will </p>
<p class="calibre2">let us know.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr.  Drew  said  he  would  appreciate  this,  as  his  group  intended  to  fly  back  to  Tokyo  that </p>
<p class="calibre2">same day. “Meanwhile, we’ll tour the pearl farm.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A  guide  took  the  visitors  offshore  in  a  boat,  showing  them  the  long  bamboo  rafts  that </p>
<p class="calibre2">contained the oyster beds. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“The oysters hang from the rafts in wire-mesh or plastic baskets,” he explained. “They feed </p>
<p class="calibre2">on plankton and must be cleaned from time to time. We have a crew here that inspects the </p>
<p class="calibre2">beds daily. The men must keep an eye on worn or broken ropes and inspect the oysters for </p>
<p class="calibre2">disease.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Who injects the nuclei?” a white-haired Englishman asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s  done  by  young  ladies  called  tamairesan.  Freely  translated,  that  means  Miss  Pearl-</p>
<p class="calibre2">pusher,” the guard replied with a smile. “The girls open the oysters carefully with a special </p>
<p class="calibre2">tool. After the operation, the oysters are allowed to rest for a while in quiet waters about </p>
<p class="calibre2">seventeen feet deep.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“It must be quite a shock to their systems,” Nancy declared. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“It is, and many eject the nucleus. We have x-ray equipment that tells us which oysters do, </p>
<p class="calibre2">and we do not bother raising those.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I see some floating buoys way out there,” Nancy remarked. “What are they for?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">32 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Those  are  experimental  glass  fiber  buoys,  roughly  one  foot  in  diameter,  which  will </p>
<p class="calibre2">eventually  replace  wooden  or  bamboo  rafts  because  they  are  more  durable  and </p>
<p class="calibre2">economical,” the guide replied. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“When are the pearls ready for harvesting?” Mr. Drew inquired. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“They are ‘beached’ after about two to three years. This takes place in the arid winter when </p>
<p class="calibre2">the  pearl-sac  cells  have  stopped  secreting  nacre,  and  the  top  layer  is  completely </p>
<p class="calibre2">crystallized.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’ll bet that’s an exciting occasion,” Nancy remarked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes, indeed. The oysters are opened one by one with small knives, and out come pearls in </p>
<p class="calibre2">many  sizes  and  different  qualities.  About  twenty  percent  cannot  be  used  at  all,  and  truly </p>
<p class="calibre2">precious pearls are quite rare.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Can you produce a bigger pearl by inserting a larger nucleus?” a blond woman asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes, but that is risky financially because large nuclei kill many oysters.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I feel sorry for the poor oysters,” Nancy said. “For two to three years they are irritated by </p>
<p class="calibre2">the foreign object inside them.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“True,” the guide admitted. “But then, nature does the same thing. Man does not harm the </p>
<p class="calibre2">oyster any more than nature does.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">When their tour was over, Nancy and her father spoke to the manager of the pearl farm and </p>
<p class="calibre2">asked if Mrs. Tanya Rossmeyer had visited the Mikimoto Farm. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“No,” he said, “and we have not heard from her. However, I will be glad to call you if Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Rossmeyer should visit us.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Drews thanked the man and gave him the Mises’ phone number, then joined the rest of </p>
<p class="calibre2">the group for the return flight. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The trip back to Tokyo was uneventful, and they reached the Mises’ home in the evening. </p>
<p class="calibre2">On the doorstep lay a note addressed to Nancy Drew. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">She  opened  it  quickly  and  held  her  breath.  The  familiar  4  +  9  =  13  equation  was  the  only </p>
<p class="calibre2">message.  Nancy  showed  it  to  the  others,  then  said  to  her  father,  “It’s  not  fair  to  put  the </p>
<p class="calibre2">Mises in any danger. I think you and I should leave here.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“You mean, go back to the United States?” her father asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Before Nancy could reply, both Mr. and Mrs. Mise spoke up. They insisted that their guests </p>
<p class="calibre2">stay with them. They were not afraid, and besides, they felt that they could give the Drews </p>
<p class="calibre2">some protection. </p>
<p class="calibre2">33 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Anyway, the person who is sending these threats may forget the whole affair if we do not </p>
<p class="calibre2">take  him  seriously.  Meanwhile,  I  suggest  that  we  get  away  from  the  house  for  more </p>
<p class="calibre2">sightseeing,” Mr. Mise said. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy and her father did not feel this way about it, but did not object to the idea. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“What do you recommend?” Mr. Drew asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“A  trip  to  the  famous  Nara  Park,”  Mr.  Mise  said.  “It  is  a  lovely  place  to  visit  and  is  full  of </p>
<p class="calibre2">interesting things to see.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mrs. Mise smiled. “Nancy, you will love the little deer that come out of the woods and greet </p>
<p class="calibre2">tourists.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Isn’t that quite a distance from here?” Nancy inquired. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes, about an hour’s flight,” Mr. Mise replied. “I will make the reservations right away.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Next morning they drove to the airport and departed for Nara. The town had been Japan’s </p>
<p class="calibre2">capital in the 8th century, preceding Kyoto and Tokyo. The visitors enjoyed the sights before </p>
<p class="calibre2">continuing to the famous park, which was a spectacularly beautiful place. People crowded </p>
<p class="calibre2">the entrance and chuckled at the small deer that clustered around them, bowing their heads </p>
<p class="calibre2">in welcome. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Aren’t they darling?” Nancy exclaimed. She patted several of the  animals, who were very </p>
<p class="calibre2">friendly,  then  followed  the  Mises  on  a  walk  along  the  paths  that  meandered  among  the </p>
<p class="calibre2">trees. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">They  finally  came  to  an  enormous  statue  of  Buddha  and  gazed  at  it  in  awe.  The  benign </p>
<p class="calibre2">figure had its right hand raised as if blessing a congregation. Mr. Drew remarked that it must </p>
<p class="calibre2">weigh an enormous amount. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Five  hundred  tons,”  Mr.  Mise  said.  “The  total  height  is  seventy-one  and  a  half  feet.  The </p>
<p class="calibre2">Buddha itself is fifty-three feet tall, and the face alone is sixteen feet in height.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“That really is tremendous,” Nancy remarked. “When was it cast?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“In the year seven hundred and forty-nine A.D. It contains several metals, but the outside is </p>
<p class="calibre2">bronze.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy  asked  her  host  about  the  main  tenets  of  Buddhism  and  its  great  teacher  Guatama </p>
<p class="calibre2">Buddha. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mrs. Mise replied, “That suffering is inherent in life, and that one can be liberated from it by </p>
<p class="calibre2">mental and moral self-purification.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">34 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy thought this over, then said, “If a person could do that, he would be perfect.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“That  is  true,”  Mr.  Mise  said.  “Many  Buddhist  priests  try  to  attain  this  goal  and  deny </p>
<p class="calibre2">themselves  most  of  the  pleasures  of  life.  We,  who  are  not  priests,  also  try  to  accept  pain </p>
<p class="calibre2">and to live moral and upright lives.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy smiled. “You are such kind, helpful people. I am sure you’re succeeding beautifully.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The  couple  seemed  embarrassed  by  the  compliment  and  changed  the  subject.  Nancy, </p>
<p class="calibre2">meanwhile,  had  noticed  how  many  people  were  taking  photographs.  Most  of  them  were </p>
<p class="calibre2">Japanese, but there was a sprinkling of visitors from countries all over the world. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly she saw a man who was snapping her picture. She stared at him and realized that </p>
<p class="calibre2">he was short, had black hair, a hard face, and was wearing a gray suit. He looked to be of </p>
<p class="calibre2">Italian descent. Could he possibly be Benny the Slippery One Caputti? </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">When the man became aware that she had spotted him, he turned and hurried around the </p>
<p class="calibre2">statue. Nancy took off after him, her camera ready to snap his picture. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">By the time she reached the rear of the great monument, the fugitive was running away at a </p>
<p class="calibre2">fast clip. Nancy pursued him and was closing the distance between them, when suddenly a </p>
<p class="calibre2">guard stepped up and stopped her. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Please! You must not pursue an innocent man in this holy park!” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy  was  amazed.  What  made  the  guard  think  that  the  fleeing  man  was  innocent? </p>
<p class="calibre2">Certainly the fact that he was racing away made him highly suspect! </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">She said, “I don’t think that man is innocent. I believe he’s wanted by the police!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly Nancy realized that the guard had spoken English without the slightest accent, and </p>
<p class="calibre2">that he did not look Japanese. Was he a friend of Caputti’s and had he borrowed or stolen </p>
<p class="calibre2">the Japanese guard’s uniform? </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The girl decided to pay no attention to him and started to hurry off. He grabbed her by the </p>
<p class="calibre2">shoulders. “Don’t you dare run away!” he hissed at her. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
