<h3 class="sigilNotInTOC">Rising Sun Insignia </h3>

<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">NANCY  stared  at  the  disheveled  room  for  a  moment,  shocked  and  surprised.  Then  she </p>
<p class="calibre2">retreated  silently,  waved  to  Bess  and  George,  and hurried to the  front door.  With a  quick </p>
<p class="calibre2">good-by to Mr. Kikichi, who looked angry, the girls left Moto’s shop. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Outside, Nancy told what she had seen. “Let’s walk around the place. Perhaps we can pick </p>
<p class="calibre2">up a clue as to what happened,” she suggested. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Two cars were parked in the driveway to the right, and several tire tracks led to the street. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy examined them closely. An unusual one caught her eye. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“It has a Rising Sun insignia,” she thought. “I wonder whether those tires came from Japan.” </p>
<p class="calibre2">She  checked  the  tires  of  the  two  parked  autos,  but  neither  had  treads  with  a  Rising  Sun </p>
<p class="calibre2">mark. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The young sleuth showed Bess and George what she had found. “The tracks are still clear. I </p>
<p class="calibre2">wonder if the person whose car made them knows Mr. Moto and gave him a ride?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">She followed the tracks down the driveway until they ended in the street. Here there were </p>
<p class="calibre2">so many criss-crossing marks that it was impossible to tell which way the car with the Rising </p>
<p class="calibre2">Sun tires had gone. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Disappointed,  Nancy  returned  to  the  shop.  She  asked  Mr.  Kikichi  if  he  knew  anyone  who </p>
<p class="calibre2">owned a car with Japanese tires. He shook his head. “No. Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">She did not answer. Instead she said, “Mr. Moto was gone by the time you arrived here this </p>
<p class="calibre2">morning?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">15 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“And the back room was a mess when you came?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Don’t  you  think  that’s  rather  unusual?  Mr.  Moto  was  a  very  neat  man.  He  never  would </p>
<p class="calibre2">have left his place looking like that.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“You mean,” said Mr. Kikichi, “that you suspect foul play? If so, why would Mr. Moto have </p>
<p class="calibre2">telephoned me about his plans?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy said she did not know, but possibly something had happened to him afterwards. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“When did he call you?” she inquired. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yesterday. I had just finished dinner.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’ll go outside and ask people in the area if they saw anyone here last night or very early </p>
<p class="calibre2">this morning,” Nancy told him. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Bess and George, meanwhile, had walked up and down the street, waiting for Nancy. When </p>
<p class="calibre2">she did not reappear, they continued searching for clues. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">By this time, Nancy had left Mr. Moto’s shop through the back door, trying to find someone </p>
<p class="calibre2">to ask about the jeweler. She noticed the neighbor from upstairs to whom she had spoken </p>
<p class="calibre2">the day before. The woman was about to cross the street. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy hurried toward her and asked if she had been aware of any disturbance in Mr. Moto’s </p>
<p class="calibre2">place the previous night. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“No,” the neighbor replied. She added with a laugh, “Once my husband goes to sleep, I can’t </p>
<p class="calibre2">hear anything but his snoring. Why, is something wrong?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I don’t know,” the young sleuth replied. “Mr. Moto left very suddenly for Japan.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s strange,” said the woman, who introduced herself as Mrs. Rooney. “I was speaking </p>
<p class="calibre2">to him just the other day and asked him if he had any intention of visiting his homeland. He </p>
<p class="calibre2">said no, not for a while. He was going to wait until he retired in a few years.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Does he have any family in Japan?” Nancy asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes, a brother, Tetsuo, who lives in Tokyo. Mr. Moto told me about him many times. He’s a </p>
<p class="calibre2">widower and has visited the United States twice.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy thanked Mrs. Rooney and went to look for Bess and George. She found them a few </p>
<p class="calibre2">minutes later. </p>
<p class="calibre2">16 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">George held a pair of men’s Japanese sandals in her hands. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Where did you get these?” Nancy asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“We found them under a bush next to the driveway,” George said. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I wonder if they belong to Mr. Moto,” Bess said. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy examined the  leather  sandals.  “They  are quite  large,”  she  said. “And Mr. Moto  is  a </p>
<p class="calibre2">small man.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Let’s ask Mr. Kikichi,” George declared. “They might belong to him, even though he’s not a </p>
<p class="calibre2">tall person, either.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The girls went back into the shop and showed their find to Mr. Moto’s friend. “Oh, no,” he </p>
<p class="calibre2">said.  “These  do  not  belong  to  me,  and  they  would  not  fit  Mr.  Moto.  Not  many  Japanese </p>
<p class="calibre2">have large feet like this!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A customer walked in at that moment, and Mr. Kikichi went to help her. Bess, George, and </p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy walked outside again. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“What are you going to do with those sandals?” Bess asked Nancy. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m holding on to them for a while,” Nancy said. “I have a hunch they might be a clue.” She </p>
<p class="calibre2">put them in her car, then told her friends what she had learned from Mrs. Rooney. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I don’t believe Mr. Moto went to Japan to visit his brother without planning this ahead,” </p>
<p class="calibre2">George said after hearing the story. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy nodded. “I’m afraid he may have been kidnapped!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Bess and George agreed. “The fact that he didn’t call Nancy or her father after he had asked </p>
<p class="calibre2">them for help just a day or so before is very suspicious,” George declared. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“That, and the messed up room,” Bess added. “Do you think we should tell Chief McGinnis </p>
<p class="calibre2">about this, Nancy?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes, but first I’ll get in touch with Dad. Maybe he’ll have an idea.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Bess sighed. “This is becoming too much for me. Stolen jewels, missing persons, a possible </p>
<p class="calibre2">kidnapping! I want no part of it.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“For the time being, you’ll get your wish,” George said, glancing at her watch. “We promised </p>
<p class="calibre2">your mother we would take her shopping. Did you forget?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’ll drive you home,” Nancy offered. </p>
<p class="calibre2">17 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh,  no.  We’ll  walk,”  Bess  said.  “It  isn’t  far.  You  go  back  to  your  sleuthing  so  you’ll  be  all </p>
<p class="calibre2">finished when we see you later.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy grinned. “I doubt that I’ll be that lucky.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As the girls walked off, she decided to talk to Mr. Kikichi again. “He must be wondering what </p>
<p class="calibre2">we were doing there and why we asked so many questions,” she thought. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">When she entered the shop, he emerged from the back room. “I was locking the rear door,” </p>
<p class="calibre2">he announced. “What do you wish?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I wanted to tell you that I’m trying to find a clue to who might have come in here last night </p>
<p class="calibre2">and wrecked Mr. Moto’s room,” Nancy explained to him. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I see,” said Mr. Kikichi. He looked at her but made no comment except to say that he would </p>
<p class="calibre2">straighten up the room when he had a chance. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy promised she would be in touch with him in case she heard from Mr. Moto, then left. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">She drove to her father’s office and told him what she had seen. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“It certainly appears suspicious,” he agreed. “It’s possible there was foul play, and Mr. Moto </p>
<p class="calibre2">was taken to Japan by force. I’ll get in touch with the airlines and see what I can find out. If </p>
<p class="calibre2">they  have  no  record  of  his  leaving,  I’ll  contact  other  likely  airports.  I’ll  also  check  on  Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Kikichi and notify the police.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy said  good-by  to her father,  but did  not  go  home.  Instead,  she decided  to follow  up </p>
<p class="calibre2">the clue of the Rising Sun tire. She went to a large garage and asked the manager if people </p>
<p class="calibre2">in town used tires with that symbol. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“No,” the man replied. “I know of only one person in River Heights who does. I guess he im </p>
<p class="calibre2">ports them from Japan.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Is he American or Japanese?” Nancy asked with increasing enthusiasm. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, he’s Japanese, but he lives in this country. For some time now he has had a home on </p>
<p class="calibre2">the outskirts of town. I understand he travels to Japan a lot, though.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy was elated. “Do you know his name?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes. Mr. Kampura.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy thanked the man and went to a public telephone booth to consult the directory. To </p>
<p class="calibre2">her disappointment, Mr. Kampura was not listed. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">18 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The young sleuth drove back to her father’s office and told him what she had found out. Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Drew called Chief McGinnis and asked if he knew Mr. Kampura. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Not  personally,”  the  officer  replied.  “But  I  understand  he  has  rented  a  place  outside  of </p>
<p class="calibre2">town.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“What business is he in?” the lawyer inquired. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“He’s in the wholesale jewelry business. I believe he works for World Wide Gems, Inc. If you </p>
<p class="calibre2">want to contact him, you’d better hurry. He’s leaving the United States on Thursday.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy had overheard the conversation. “You know, Dad,” she said excitedly, “it appears as if </p>
<p class="calibre2">all our leads point to Japan!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Her father smiled. “You’re right. Especially since I’ve found out that the World Wide Gems </p>
<p class="calibre2">headquarters are in Tokyo!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, Dad—” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I know. You want to go there—” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes! On the same flight that Mr. Kampura is taking!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Let me think about this for a moment.” Mr. Drew went outside to speak to his secretary, </p>
<p class="calibre2">then  returned,  smiling.  “I  just  checked  on  a  few  things.  I  have  several  business  clients  in </p>
<p class="calibre2">Tokyo, and it might not be a bad idea to see them personally. We could—” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh,  Dad,  you’re  wonderful!”  Nancy  jumped  up  and  gave  her  father  a  big  hug.  “Perhaps </p>
<p class="calibre2">Professor Mise could call his brother and tell him we’re coming!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Good  idea.  You  get  in  touch  with  him,  and  I’ll  take  care  of  the  reservations.  Then  you’d </p>
<p class="calibre2">better pack your wardrobe, and lay out some things for me that you think I might need.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Excited, Nancy drove home and told Hannah Gruen about the proposed trip. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“My, my,” said Hannah. “You certainly do get around solving mysteries. This latest one is in </p>
<p class="calibre2">beautiful Japan?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy laughed. “I don’t know whether I’ll find the solution there, but it’s where all my clues </p>
<p class="calibre2">lead to. I’m really worried about Mr. Moto.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The  kindly  housekeeper  said  she  was  glad  Nancy  and  her  father  were  leaving.  “With </p>
<p class="calibre2">underworld characters here who might have harmed Mr. Moto, I think it’s a good idea that </p>
<p class="calibre2">you’re going out of town.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">19 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy phoned Professor Mise to tell him the news. A half hour later he called back and said </p>
<p class="calibre2">he had telephoned his brother and that Toshio Mise and his wife would be happy  to have </p>
<p class="calibre2">the Drews as guests in their home, and they would pick them up at the airport. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy passed the message on to her father when he came home. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s extremely nice of the Mises,” he said. “I hope we’ll be able to repay them somehow </p>
<p class="calibre2">for their hospitality.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Have you any news on Mr. Moto?” Nancy inquired hopefully. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“He didn’t fly out of any of the coastal airports, at least not under his own name. But if he </p>
<p class="calibre2">was kidnapped and taken to Japan, I’m sure his abductors provided a fake passport.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Which  would  make  it  even  harder  for  us,”  Nancy  said.  “Oh,  I  do  hope  we  find  out  what </p>
<p class="calibre2">happened to him.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">When Nancy and her father reached the airport in New York on Thursday, he said, “How do </p>
<p class="calibre2">you propose to identify Mr. Kampura? There might be many Japanese on board our plane.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A  sudden  idea  came to Nancy.  “Let’s have  him paged and  wait  near the  check-in  counter. </p>
<p class="calibre2">When he shows up, we can see what he looks like.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Her  father  agreed,  stepped  up  to  the  desk,  and  put  in  the  request.  Then  he  and  Nancy </p>
<p class="calibre2">walked out of sight, but watched the counter carefully from a distance. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Soon a Japanese man arrived to answer the call. He was about six feet tall, slender, and had </p>
<p class="calibre2">a severe, square-jawed face. He reminded Nancy of Genghis Khan’s cruel raiders of ancient </p>
<p class="calibre2">times. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr. Drew turned to his daughter and whispered, “Nancy, don’t ever tangle with him!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Drews hurried away before Kampura could learn that the call was a fake. “Dad,” Nancy </p>
<p class="calibre2">said,  “remember  I  told  you  about  the  sandals  Bess  and  George  found  in  Mr.  Moto’s </p>
<p class="calibre2">driveway?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“They were rather large for a Japanese man, yet they were made in Japan.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Many sandals are.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“But these were not the kind usually sold in our country.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I see what you mean. You think they might belong to Mr. Kampura because he’s very tall?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">20 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes! Between the sandals and the tire tracks with the Rising Sun insignia, I’m convinced Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Kampura was in Mr. Moto’s shop recently!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m inclined to agree,” Mr. Drew said. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Just then a message came over the loudspeaker. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Will Mr. Campbell Drewry please go to the nearest phone?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy’s  father  winked  at  her  and  headed  for  a  booth.  The  girl  was  puzzled.  Slowly  she </p>
<p class="calibre2">followed her father and watched him pick up the receiver. Why had he answered the call? </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly an idea came to Nancy. She recalled that Campbell was her father’s middle name, </p>
<p class="calibre2">which he never used. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Clever!”  she  thought  to  herself,  a  smile  spreading  across  her  face.  “Dad  must  have </p>
<p class="calibre2">instructed his office to use that name in case they had a message for him before he left. This </p>
<p class="calibre2">way he could not be identified,” Nancy thought. “I wonder what the message is?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
