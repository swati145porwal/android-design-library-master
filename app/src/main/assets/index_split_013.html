<h3 class="sigilNotInTOC">The Party Thief </h3>

<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">54 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">MRS. MISE was very upset, and she was on the verge of tears. “This is so bad,” she said, “so </p>
<p class="calibre2">very bad.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy patted the  woman’s hands.  “Let’s try not  to  take this  warning too  seriously.  I  think </p>
<p class="calibre2">that  whoever  has  been  writing  these  notes  is  a  coward.  If  not,  he  would  have  done </p>
<p class="calibre2">something more drastic by this time.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr.  Drew  knew  that  Nancy  was  trying  to  make  their  hostess  feel  better.  He  doubted, </p>
<p class="calibre2">however, that Nancy could take the matter so lightly. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He  was  right.  Secretly  Nancy  was  greatly  worried.  She  had  a  feeling  that  her  adversary </p>
<p class="calibre2">desperately wanted to frighten her. Nancy asked Mr. Mise if he would try to find the porter </p>
<p class="calibre2">who had brought him the note. “I’ll go with you,” she added. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Together  they  hurried  to  the  lobby  of  the  hotel  and  walked  past  the  porters  who  were </p>
<p class="calibre2">seated on a bench in a little niche. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr.  Mise  shook  his head.  “I  don’t  see the  young  man  here,”  he  declared.  “Maybe he  was </p>
<p class="calibre2">from another hotel.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy asked, “Did he wear the same uniform as these men?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr.  Mise  nodded.  “That  means  he  could  not  be  from  another  hotel.”  Suddenly  a  smile </p>
<p class="calibre2">crossed his face. “Here he comes now!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A young man was walking out of an elevator. Mr. Mise and Nancy went up to him, and the </p>
<p class="calibre2">two Japanese conversed for a few minutes. Then Mr. Mise translated for Nancy. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“The  porter  says  that  a  little  boy  arrived  with  the  note,  then  left  the  hotel.  He  does  not </p>
<p class="calibre2">know whether the child came from the street or whether he is staying at the hotel.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“In  other  words,  someone probably  gave  him  a tip  to bring  the  note to the  porter,  so the </p>
<p class="calibre2">real sender couldn’t be traced,” Nancy reasoned. “Very clever.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Whom do you suspect the sender is?” Mr. Mise asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Benny Caputti. He either  followed us or happened to see us here. If the latter is true, he </p>
<p class="calibre2">was in the hotel. In either case, he might still be here!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“And you would like to find him,” Mr. Mise said with a smile. “But it is a large place, and you </p>
<p class="calibre2">cannot search the rooms!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I know,” Nancy said. “But Benny would be where the jewelry is—” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Which is at the reception!” Mr. Mise completed her sentence. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Right. Let’s go back there and tell Dad.” </p>
<p class="calibre2">55 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">When  Mr.  Drew  and  Mrs.  Mise  heard  about  what  had  happened,  they  offered  to  look </p>
<p class="calibre2">around  for  a  man  who  matched  Caputti’s  description.  Nancy  and  her  father  went  off </p>
<p class="calibre2">together. The Mises walked in a different direction. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Presently Nancy  noticed  a  short,  black-haired  man  who, although  he  was  not  dressed  in a </p>
<p class="calibre2">gray suit, was obviously American or European like Caputti. He was walking quietly among </p>
<p class="calibre2">the guests, when Mr. Mise appeared on the scene and took her arm. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Nancy,  I  would  like  you  to  meet  Mr.  Shopwell.  He  is  president  of  an  American  bank  in </p>
<p class="calibre2">Tokyo.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy managed to hide her surprise and shook hands with Mr. Shopwell. How glad she was </p>
<p class="calibre2">that she had said nothingl </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The  Drews  and  Mr.  Mise  spoke  to  the  bank  president  for  a  while,  then  continued  their </p>
<p class="calibre2">sleuthing.  Nancy  saw  another  man  some  distance  away  who  was  dressed  in  black  dinner </p>
<p class="calibre2">clothes and fit the description of Benny the Slippery One. Suddenly she stopped short and </p>
<p class="calibre2">grabbed her father’s arm. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Look!” she said. “That man! He’s snipping a pearl necklace right off that woman’s neck!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The  young  detective  and  her father  made their  way  through  the  crowd  to  close  in on the </p>
<p class="calibre2">thief, who had slipped the necklace into his right pants pocket. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He was walking away from the woman with quick steps. When Nancy and her father caught </p>
<p class="calibre2">up to him, they each took an arm. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“We saw you steal that woman’s necklace!” Nancy accused him. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“That is a lie!” the thief cried out. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“You can’t deny it,” Mr. Drew said. “The necklace is in your right pants pocket!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The  suspect  stepped  a  few  paces  away.  “You  are  wrong!”  he  insisted,  still  backing  up </p>
<p class="calibre2">further. “You are wrong. I’ll prove it to you!” With that he turned the pocket inside out. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Several coins fell to the floor, but that was all. The pearl necklace was not among them! </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy and her father were stunned. It seemed like the work of a magician. The Drews had </p>
<p class="calibre2">to agree that the necklace was indeed not there and apologized as the man angrily pushed </p>
<p class="calibre2">the pocket back into its place. Then he picked up his coins from the floor. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“But I saw you take it!” Nancy insisted. “I’m sure I saw you take it. But if I was wrong, I’m </p>
<p class="calibre2">sorry.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">56 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“He’s slipping a pearl necklace off that woman’s neck!” Nancy said. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The man nodded and turned to leave. The Drews walked away quickly before there might </p>
<p class="calibre2">be a scene. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I  can’t  understand  what  happened,”  Mr.  Drew  said  tensely.  “We  both  watched  him  take </p>
<p class="calibre2">that necklace!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I have an idea,” Nancy spoke up. “Maybe there was a hole in his pocket, the pearls fell to </p>
<p class="calibre2">the  floor,  and  were  picked  up  by  an  accomplice!  Remember,  there  were  a  few  people </p>
<p class="calibre2">between us and that man, so we might not have seen the necklace drop.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“You’re right,” her father agreed. “Let’s go back to the spot and see what we can learn.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">By the time they reached the area where the theft had occurred, the owner had discovered </p>
<p class="calibre2">her loss. She was Japanese, and began exclaiming in bitter tones in her language. The Drews </p>
<p class="calibre2">did not understand what she was saying but noticed another guest hurrying up to her. She </p>
<p class="calibre2">was  an  American  who  apparently  understood  some  Japanese.  However,  she  spoke  to  the </p>
<p class="calibre2">woman  in  English.  “I  saw  a  necklace  on  the  floor  a  few  minutes  ago.  A  Japanese  woman </p>
<p class="calibre2">picked it up, slipped it into her purse, and walked off. I assumed it belonged to her.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr. Drew whispered to his daughter, “You were right about the hole in the thief’s pocket. </p>
<p class="calibre2">And the woman who picked up the necklace was indeed an accomplice.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy was annoyed at herself for letting the thief slip through her fingers so easily. Why had </p>
<p class="calibre2">she not looked for a hole in his pocket when he turned it inside out? </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">She  spoke  to  the  guest  who  had  watched  the  person  pick  up  the  pearls  from  the  floor. </p>
<p class="calibre2">“Would you recognize her if you saw her again?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I  believe  I  would,”  the  American  replied.  “She  wore  a  very  pretty  kimono  and  carried  a </p>
<p class="calibre2">matching handbag.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Would you mind pointing her out to me?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">When the woman hesitated, Nancy added, “I’m trying to catch a thief, and I believe he’s at </p>
<p class="calibre2">this party.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The  American  consented,  while  Mr.  Drew  asked  other  guests  if  any  of  their  jewelry  was </p>
<p class="calibre2">missing.  Suddenly  there  was  a  hubbub  as  one  woman  after  another  discovered  that  their </p>
<p class="calibre2">gems had been stolen. Bracelets, necklaces, pins, and hair ornaments were gone. A valuable </p>
<p class="calibre2">ruby and diamond necklace was reported by a friend of the bride to have been stolen. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr. Mise notified the police, and a number of officers arrived in a few minutes to search for </p>
<p class="calibre2">the thief. All guests cooperated and permitted themselves to be searched. </p>
<p class="calibre2">57 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A young officer asked Nancy for her purse. She smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I don’t have one with me,” she said. “I put my comb into the bottom of my kimono sleeve </p>
<p class="calibre2">as I understand Japanese women often do.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Then I must examine your sleeves,” the officer said. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He found nothing in the left one, then reached into the right. To Nancy’s horror he pulled </p>
<p class="calibre2">out a gorgeous ruby and diamond necklace! </p>
