<h3 class="sigilNotInTOC">Mr. Moto </h3>

<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“How would you girls like a drink of pearl powder?” Nancy Drew asked her friends Bess and </p>
<p class="calibre2">George. “It’s calcium and is guaranteed to cure anything that’s wrong with you.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The  two  girls  laughed,  sure  that  Nancy  was  joking.  The  attractive,  blue-eyed,  strawberry </p>
<p class="calibre2">blond sleuth shook her head. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m not kidding. It’s true.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Bess, a slightly overweight blond who, like the others, was eighteen years old, made a face. </p>
<p class="calibre2">“You know how I like to eat, but powder made from pearls!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">George,  to  whom  food  meant  little,  was  a  slender  athletic-looking  brunette.  “So  far  as  I </p>
<p class="calibre2">know, there’s nothing wrong with me, so I’ll pass.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, Nancy,” Bess urged, “tell us what the joke is.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Once more Nancy insisted that pearl powder had been used extensively as a cure-all. “In an </p>
<p class="calibre2">cient  Japan  and  other  Asiatic  and  Oriental  countries,  it  was  very  popular.  Nowadays </p>
<p class="calibre2">1 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">physicians prescribe  other  medications, but pearl  powder  can  still  be purchased  in  certain </p>
<p class="calibre2">pharmacies.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">George stopped smiling and looked intently at her friend. “My guess is that you’ve started </p>
<p class="calibre2">working on a new mystery, and it has something to do with pearls. Am I right?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes,” Nancy replied. “There’s a Japanese jeweler in town who’s a specialist in repairing fine </p>
<p class="calibre2">old pieces of jewelry. His name is Mr. Moto. Recently he came to my Dad asking for help on </p>
<p class="calibre2">a mystery.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Bess spoke up. “But your dad isn’t a detective. He’s a lawyer.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“True,” Nancy agreed, “but in this case, a fantastic theft took place. Mr. Moto didn’t want to </p>
<p class="calibre2">go to the police because, if the loss became known, he feared it might cause international </p>
<p class="calibre2">complications.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">George took a deep breath. “I’m hooked. Tell us more.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy told the girls that a large firm with offices all over the world might be involved. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Bess interrupted. “Is this very confidential?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Very,” Nancy replied. She went on to say that her father was unable to help with the case </p>
<p class="calibre2">at the present time and had told Mr. Moto that Nancy was an amateur detective. Mr. Drew </p>
<p class="calibre2">had suggested that the three girls start working on the mystery until he could take over. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“What did Mr. Moto say?” Bess asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“He agreed.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Greatl” George exclaimed. “When shall we begin?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Right now,” Nancy  replied.  “I’ll  tell  Hannah  where  we’re  going.”  She  was  referring  to the </p>
<p class="calibre2">Drews’ lovely housekeeper, who had acted as a mother to Nancy since she was three years </p>
<p class="calibre2">old and her own mother had passed away. At the moment Hannah Gruen was in the kitchen </p>
<p class="calibre2">bak ing a lemon meringue pie, which happened to be Mr. Drew’s favorite dessert. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Minutes later the girls drove off in Nancy’s sleek blue car to the center of River Heights. As </p>
<p class="calibre2">they turned into a side street looking for the jewelry shop, Bess suddenly said, “Oh, there it </p>
<p class="calibre2">is. But what’s happening?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy and George gazed at the front door of the shop. A young Asiatic man was racing from </p>
<p class="calibre2">the store with a pearl necklace dangling from one hand. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’ll bet he’s a thief!” George cried out. “Let’s nab him!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">2 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">But by the time Nancy stopped her car at the curb across from the jeweler’s, the young man </p>
<p class="calibre2">had jumped into an automobile and sped off in the opposite direction. Unfortunately, the </p>
<p class="calibre2">car had been too far away for Nancy and the others to glimpse the number on the license </p>
<p class="calibre2">plate. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’ll bet he’s a thief!” George cried out. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh dear!” Bess said with a sigh. “There was our chance to be heroines, and we lost it!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy was eager to see if Mr. Moto was all right and hurried across the street into the shop. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Bess and George followed. No one was inside, but in a few moments an elderly, kind-looking </p>
<p class="calibre2">Japanese man came from a rear room. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He smiled and bowed to the girls. “May I assist you?” he asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy spoke quickly. “We just saw a young man run from your shop with a pearl necklace in </p>
<p class="calibre2">his hand. Did he buy it?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“No. I have been in the back room. I did not see or hear anyone.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He looked into a display case, then clasped his hands in dismay. “It is gone! A very expensive </p>
<p class="calibre2">necklace!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy, Bess, and George described the young man as best as they could. Mr. Moto did not </p>
<p class="calibre2">recognize him. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“He was a thief, indeed!” the jeweler lamented. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The girls expressed their sympathy, and Nancy asked Mr. Moto if he was going to call the </p>
<p class="calibre2">police. The rather frail-looking jeweler shook his head. “Not now. I have a bigger problem on </p>
<p class="calibre2">my mind.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I know,” Nancy said and introduced herself and the other girls. “You came to see my father </p>
<p class="calibre2">about the theft of an unusual piece of jewelry. He told you that until he is free, we would </p>
<p class="calibre2">work on your case.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr.  Moto  frowned.  The  girls  assumed  that  he  was  thinking,  “What  do  they  know  about </p>
<p class="calibre2">solving mysteries?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Bess  spoke  up  at  once  and  glibly  told  how  many  cases  Nancy  had  successfully  concluded. </p>
<p class="calibre2">“And sometimes George and I helped her,” she added. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr.  Moto  stroked  his  chin.  “Ah,  so.  Then  I  will  tell  you  about  my  trouble.  But  you  must </p>
<p class="calibre2">promise to keep this matter to yourselves.” </p>
<p class="calibre2">3 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Each girl said she would honor his secret. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I  have  a  client named Mrs.  Tanya  Rossmeyer,”  the  jeweler  began.  “She  is  a  very  wealthy </p>
<p class="calibre2">lady and  owns  a  great deal  of  expensive  jewelry.  Her  most  precious  piece  is  a  necklace of </p>
<p class="calibre2">pearls. There are twelve on each side of a very large one, which has the luster of the moon. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The strand is made of natural, not cultured pearls.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“It must be worth a fortune!” Bess burst out. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“It is,” Mr. Moto agreed. “I believe there is no other one like it in the world.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy asked him about the theft. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Someone  entered  my  shop  and  opened  the  safe,”  Mr.  Moto  replied.  “He  cut  off  the </p>
<p class="calibre2">thirteenth pearl from the rest of the strand. Mrs. Rossmeyer will be very angry and sue me </p>
<p class="calibre2">for a lot of money. I will lose my insurance and will be forced to close my shop!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The  three  girls  were  surprised  that  the  burglar  had  cut  only  one  pearl  from  the  necklace. </p>
<p class="calibre2">How much easier it would have been to steal the whole thing! </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy said, “Would you let us see the part of the necklace that you still have?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The  jeweler  obligingly  opened  the  safe,  which  was  built  into  the  counter  and  was  well-</p>
<p class="calibre2">hidden from view. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy thought, “A casual customer would not realize this is a safe. The thief must have been </p>
<p class="calibre2">somebody who knows about it, besides being an expert safe-cracker.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr.  Moto  twirled  the  dials  of  the  lock  left  and  right,  then  opened  the  heavy  door.  Inside </p>
<p class="calibre2">were many small drawers. He pulled one out and reached in for the pearl necklace. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“You  see  where—”  he  began,  then  stared  at  the  strand  before  him.  Finally  he  cried  out, </p>
<p class="calibre2">“This  is  not  Mrs.  Rossmeyer’s  necklace!  The  thief  substituted  this  one!  These  are  smaller </p>
<p class="calibre2">than Mrs. Rossmeyer’s pearls. Oh—she—” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The jeweler suddenly put a hand in his pocket, then fainted, sinking to the floor. The girls </p>
<p class="calibre2">ran behind the counter. Nancy and Bess picked him up and carried him to the back room. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“George, shut the front door and lock it!” Nancy called out. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After putting Mr. Moto on a couch, she felt in his pocket where he had put his hand, and she </p>
<p class="calibre2">discovered a small bottle of heart tablets. Quickly she placed one under the man’s tongue. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Don’t you think we should call a doctor?” Bess asked worriedly. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">4 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy thought that Mr. Moto probably had attacks like this from time to time and carried </p>
<p class="calibre2">the special pills for that reason. “If he doesn’t revive in a few minutes, then we’d better call </p>
<p class="calibre2">an ambulance.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">George had locked the front door and had gone behind the counter. She restored the pearl </p>
<p class="calibre2">necklace to the safe and closed the heavy door. Then she twirled the knob back and forth </p>
<p class="calibre2">and tried the handle. The safe was locked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">By this time Mr. Moto had recovered in the back room but was glad to lie on the couch. He </p>
<p class="calibre2">insisted he did not need a doctor but asked the girls not to leave him for a while. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">George reported that she had locked everything, and he thanked her. “You are most kind,” </p>
<p class="calibre2">he said. “When I first noticed that the thirteenth pearl was gone, I was so excited that I did </p>
<p class="calibre2">not examine the rest of the necklace. Now I know the substitute is not nearly as valuable as </p>
<p class="calibre2">the stolen one. Oh, oh! What shall I do?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy suggested that Mr. Moto lie still until he felt completely well. He agreed and used this </p>
<p class="calibre2">time to tell them the full story of what he suspected had happened. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I believe the thief who was here is working for an international organization called World </p>
<p class="calibre2">Wide Gems, Incorporated, which deals in old and rare jewelry. Recently it has been hinted in </p>
<p class="calibre2">the trade that an underworld organization has infiltrated World Wide Gems. This does not </p>
<p class="calibre2">mean  that  the  whole  company  is  dishonest,  but  it  is  felt  that  certain  employees  are  not </p>
<p class="calibre2">above steal ing. No one dares accuse World Wide Gems, since it might stir up real trouble </p>
<p class="calibre2">and even cause blood-shed at the hands of the powerful underworld group.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“But why did the thief leave the substitute necklace?” George asked, puzzled. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Probably  he  did  not  want  to  leave  that  compartment  in  my  safe  empty.  With  the  other </p>
<p class="calibre2">necklace in it, I might not have noticed the loss for a while,” Mr. Moto replied. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Where is World Wide Gems located?” Nancy inquired. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“They have branches in many big cities all over the world,” Mr. Moto replied. “You can see </p>
<p class="calibre2">that an investigation of them would cause many problems.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes,  it  would,”  came  the  stern  voice  of  an  unseen  man.  “You’d  better  forget  the  whole </p>
<p class="calibre2">thing if you value your life!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr. Moto and the girls were startled. Nancy and her friends jumped up and ran to the back </p>
<p class="calibre2">door  from  where  the  voice  had  seemed  to  originate.  No  one  was  there!  Puzzled,  they </p>
<p class="calibre2">searched the premises inside and out, but in vain. It was as if a ghost had spoken. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Bess shivered. “This is positively spooky!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">5 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
