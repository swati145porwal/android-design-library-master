<h3 class="sigilNotInTOC">Suspicious Taxi Driver </h3>

<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’M SORRY, miss, but Mrs. Rossmeyer checked out a few minutes ago,” the clerk said. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Did she say where she was going?” Nancy asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He shook his head. “Is it important that you find out?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes, it is. Very important. Is there any way I can get this information?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The  obliging  clerk  asked  his  assistant to  take  over, then  came  from behind  the  desk.  With </p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy at his side, he inquired at the travel agency in the hotel and asked several porters and </p>
<p class="calibre2">the maid who took care of Mrs. Rossmeyer’s room. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">His  efforts  were  in  vain,  until  a  porter,  just  coming  in  from  outside,  told  him  that  the </p>
<p class="calibre2">socialite had departed for the airport. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy thanked the kind clerk, then telephoned the Mise home. The maid answered and said </p>
<p class="calibre2">that both Mr. Drew and Mr. Mise had gone into the city on business. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Then may I speak to the man who is guarding the house?” Nancy asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">When  Mr.  Natuske  came  to  the  phone,  she  told  him  what  she  had  learned  about  Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Rossmeyer’s departure. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Do you know where Mr. Mise has gone?” Nancy asked him. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">50 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes, to his bank.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy requested its name, then made a call. She was able to catch Mr. Mise and told him </p>
<p class="calibre2">about  Mrs.  Rossmeyer.  “Could  you  get  in  touch  with  the  airport  authorities  and  find  out </p>
<p class="calibre2">where she’s going?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr. Mise promised to do so at once. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy returned to the beauty salon. She and Mrs. Mise paid their bills, then left the hotel. </p>
<p class="calibre2">On the way home, Nancy told her companion what she had learned from the clerk, and that </p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr. Mise would follow the trail. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">When  they  arrived  at  the  house,  Nancy  went  to  talk  further  with  Mr.  Natsuke.  She  asked </p>
<p class="calibre2">him if anything had happened since she had spoken to him on the phone. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes,” he replied. “I saw a man sneaking around the house and taking pictures of both the </p>
<p class="calibre2">first and second floors. Unfortunately, I could not get to him in time. He spotted me and ran </p>
<p class="calibre2">like a deer.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“What did he look like?” Nancy asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“He  was  Japanese,  of  medium  height,  and  wore  a  dark  business  suit.  I  got  in  touch  with </p>
<p class="calibre2">headquarters and reported it.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy remarked that the people who had been spying on the Mise property now obviously </p>
<p class="calibre2">realized that it was being guarded. “I hope none of them will return!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr. Natsuke agreed whole-heartedly. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy had just entered the house when Mr. Mise returned. Eagerly she asked him if he had </p>
<p class="calibre2">any luck chasing Mrs. Rossmeyer. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes and no,” the Japanese replied. “I was told by the airline that she and her maid departed </p>
<p class="calibre2">for Rome. But just before leaving, there had been a commotion in the terminal building.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“A  commotion?”  Nancy asked  in  surprise.  Mr.  Mise  nodded.  “When  the  police  rushed  up, </p>
<p class="calibre2">they learned that Mrs. Rossmeyer had been robbed of two strands of pearls and a valuable </p>
<p class="calibre2">ruby and pearl pin!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“How dreadful!” Nancy exclaimed, then asked if the authorities had obtained any clues to </p>
<p class="calibre2">the thieves. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Perhaps,” Mr. Mise replied. “Mrs. Rossmeyer said she suspected the driver of a private taxi </p>
<p class="calibre2">that had picked her up at the hotel. She had used him several times before while in Japan </p>
<p class="calibre2">and had always found him honest. But now he is a prime suspect because he was the only </p>
<p class="calibre2">person near her during the trip to the airport. He took her bags and assisted her from the </p>
<p class="calibre2">cab. The theft could have happened then.” </p>
<p class="calibre2">51 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Did the police get his name and address?” Nancy asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr. Mise said Mrs. Rossmeyer had given it to them. “He is Joe Slate, a Japanese, although he </p>
<p class="calibre2">was born in the United States. He drives Americans who speak only English.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Did the authorities get in touch with him?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“They called his home, and there was no answer. When they went to his house, they found </p>
<p class="calibre2">that  he  had  disappeared.  He  lived  in  a  furnished  apartment,  and  all  his  belongings  were </p>
<p class="calibre2">gone.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy wondered if he could be a member of the Caputti gang, since it specialized in jewel </p>
<p class="calibre2">robberies. She asked Mr. Mise if immigration and customs officials had been consulted. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I do not know, but I will contact both of them,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr. Mise spent some time on the telephone. When he returned to Nancy, he said, “Neither </p>
<p class="calibre2">immigration nor customs has any record of a Joe Slate.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy wondered if any fellow cabbies might have some information on him and suggested </p>
<p class="calibre2">that  Mr.  Mise  speak  to the police  again  and  ask  for  an  inquiry  of  all taxi  drivers  in  Toyko, </p>
<p class="calibre2">public or private. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">An hour later came a preliminary report. No one who had been questioned so far had any </p>
<p class="calibre2">idea where Joe Slate had gone. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“He slipped through our fingers,” Nancy said, disappointed. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, there are still a few drivers who have not been questioned yet. And a policeman is </p>
<p class="calibre2">stationed  across  the  street  from  Slate’s  apartment  in  case  he  should  come  back.  If  a  clue </p>
<p class="calibre2">should turn up, the police will call us.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Just  then  Mr.  Drew  arrived.  He  had  visited  another  client,  then  called  on  a  Tokyo  lawyer </p>
<p class="calibre2">who was an acquaintance of his. “I did some sleuthing of my own,” he said, “and asked this </p>
<p class="calibre2">man about Rosina Caputti.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, good!” Nancy said. “What did he tell you?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“She’s  still  in  jail  because  the  passport  she  was  using  had  been  stolen  from  a  woman  she </p>
<p class="calibre2">resembles. Fortunately, it’s now in the possession of its owner. But Mrs. Caputti still refuses </p>
<p class="calibre2">to tell why she was using a false passport to enter the country.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s no news,” Nancy said. “The news is coming now,” Mr. Drew said with a smile. “Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Caputti had a caller in jail. He gave his name as Joe Slate.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">52 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Joe Slate!” Nancy exclaimed. “That’s the name of Mrs. Rossmeyer’s private taxi driver who </p>
<p class="calibre2">is suspected of having robbed her!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">She told her father the story and asked if he had obtained a description of Joe Slate. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“He’s Japanese, medium height, and speaks English without an accent,” Mr. Drew replied. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“He sounds like the same man who drove Mrs. Rossmeyer!” Nancy declared. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr. Drew frowned. “This is very puzzling. You say Slate has disappeared? He had told Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Caputti that he would get a lawyer for her. So far no one has come.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“How long ago did he visit her?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I believe just yesterday.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At  this  moment  Mrs.  Mise  walked  up  to  them.  “I  do  not  mean  to  interrupt,”  she  said </p>
<p class="calibre2">politely, “but we must dress for the reception if we do not wish to be late.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy and her father excused themselves and went off to change their clothes. When they </p>
<p class="calibre2">appeared  a  little  while  later,  Mr.  Drew  declared  that  he had  never  seen  his  daughter  look </p>
<p class="calibre2">prettier. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy’s eyes twinkled. “You mean I might have made a good Japanese girl?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He grinned back at her. “You certainly would have made a good Japanese detective!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr. and Mrs. Mise looked charming in their outfits, but Nancy could not help but think how </p>
<p class="calibre2">distinguished her father looked in his white, formal dress. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“The ceremony will be attended only by close members of the family,” Mrs. Mise told Nancy </p>
<p class="calibre2">on the way to the hotel where the reception was to be held. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m sorry,” Nancy said. “I would have loved to have seen it.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I can tell you a little about the ceremony,” Mrs. Mise said. “Most weddings take place, as </p>
<p class="calibre2">we Japanese say, ‘before the Shinto Gods.’ Sometimes this is only a scroll with the name of a </p>
<p class="calibre2">God hanging in front of the couple as they exchange their vows, but mostly a Shinto priest </p>
<p class="calibre2">presides.  He  must  exorcise  any  evil  influences  that  the  couple  might  be  exposed  to,  and </p>
<p class="calibre2">does this with a shake of the streamers attached to a wand.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“And then they drink the ceremonial drink?” Nancy asked. “I’ve heard about that.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes. That is the most important part of the ceremony. Both bride and groom must take the </p>
<p class="calibre2">ritual  drink,  three  times,  then  another  three  times,  then  another—nine  times  in  all.  After </p>
<p class="calibre2">this  the  bride  removes  her  headgear,  signifying  that  she  has  left  her  family.  There  are  no </p>
<p class="calibre2">rings or other tokens exchanged at a Japanese wedding.” </p>
<p class="calibre2">53 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I heard that in the olden days the groom was not allowed to see the bride’s face until after </p>
<p class="calibre2">the wedding,” Nancy spoke up. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“That is true. It was feared that if he saw it, he might not wish to marry her. The removal of </p>
<p class="calibre2">the hat is still the symbolic gesture of showing her face.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">When they reached the reception, they found the newlyweds seated at the head of a long </p>
<p class="calibre2">table, while the bride’s and groom’s families were on opposite sides. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“You see the elderly man next to the couple?” Mrs. Mise said to Nancy. “He is the sponsor </p>
<p class="calibre2">of  the  wedding.  In  this  case,  he  is  a  senior  member  of  the  accounting  firm  for  whom  the </p>
<p class="calibre2">groom works.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Just  then  the  man  stood  up  and  spoke  in  Japanese.  “He’s  presenting  the  couple  to  the </p>
<p class="calibre2">party,” Mrs. Mise explained. “He tells about their families and their achievements.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After the speech, various guests sang short songs, some of which, Mrs. Mise said, were from </p>
<p class="calibre2">plays. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As  the  festivities  proceeded,  guests  mingled  and  spoke  to  the  young  couple  and  their </p>
<p class="calibre2">parents.  Nancy  noticed  the  many  jewels  the  women  were  wearing.  There  were  not  only </p>
<p class="calibre2">pearls in abundance, but diamonds, rubies, sapphires, emeralds, and semiprecious stones. </p>
<p class="calibre2">All of them were gorgeous. Most of the women wore fancy head-combs. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy thought, “What a wonderful place for a thief like Benny the Slippery One to operate!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After  wishing  the  bride  and  groom  great  happiness  in  their  married  life  and  thanking  the </p>
<p class="calibre2">newlyweds’  parents  for  inviting  them,  the  Drews  followed  the  Mises  toward  a  table  with </p>
<p class="calibre2">dainty refreshments. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">They had been there only a few minutes when one of the hotel’s messenger boys walked up </p>
<p class="calibre2">to Mr. Mise. He handed him a letter and spoke in Japanese. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After he left, Mr. Mise opened the envelope. Inside was another one addressed to Nancy. A </p>
<p class="calibre2">bit nervous about what its contents might be, she took out the message. It read:4 + 9 = 13. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Your time is getting short! </p>
