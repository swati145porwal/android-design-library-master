<h3 class="sigilNotInTOC">A Detective Assists </h3>

<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">MR.  DREW hurried  over  to  see  what  Nancy had  discovered.  She had  picked  up  something </p>
<p class="calibre2">from the ground directly under the tree. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“What is it?” he asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">She  held  out  her  hand.  In  it  lay  a  United  States  25-cent  piece.  “I’m  sure  that  man  who </p>
<p class="calibre2">climbed the tree dropped this. It implies that he’s from our country!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“You’re right,” her father agreed. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">46 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, we have a fair description of him. He’s not very tall, has black hair, wears a gray suit </p>
<p class="calibre2">of lightweight wool, and is probably an American. Do you think that’s enough for the police </p>
<p class="calibre2">to go on?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“It’s a bit sketchy, but it sounds like Benny the Slippery One,” her father replied. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">When they returned to the house to report their clue, they noticed a man walking up the </p>
<p class="calibre2">driveway toward them. They waited for him. He was Japanese but spoke perfect English. He </p>
<p class="calibre2">introduced himself as Mr. Natsuke and explained that his name meant ornamental button. </p>
<p class="calibre2">“My ancestors made them and thus received the family name.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy’s  eyes  twinkled.  “If  I  should  forget  your  name,  you  won’t  mind  if  I  call  you  Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Button?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr. Natsuke grinned and said that he was the private detective who had come to watch the </p>
<p class="calibre2">Mise house during the daytime. Later he would be relieved by a nightshift man. He carried a </p>
<p class="calibre2">radio, over which he could receive messages from headquarters. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy asked him if he could also talk to the chief. “Yes, indeed,” Mr. Natsuke replied. “Have </p>
<p class="calibre2">you a message for him?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes, I do,” Nancy replied and showed him the American quarter and the shreds of cloth she </p>
<p class="calibre2">had discovered in the tree. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“We  have  already  told  the  chief  what  the  suspect  looks  like,  and  I’m  sure  he  would  be </p>
<p class="calibre2">interested in this bit of evidence from his clothes.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The detective promised to call headquarters at once and take the threads with him when he </p>
<p class="calibre2">returned there in the evening. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy and her father thanked him and went into the house. Mrs. Mise was waiting to give </p>
<p class="calibre2">them an invitation. “My husband and I are going to a wedding this afternoon. The parents of </p>
<p class="calibre2">the bride have graciously invited you to come. I think you would be interested in watching a </p>
<p class="calibre2">Japanese wedding.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Drews were happy to accept and asked what they should wear. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mrs.  Mise  said  that  she  would  lend  Nancy  a  pretty  kimono  and  flowers  for  her  hair.  Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Drew had brought a white summer suit with him, which would be appropriate. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy turned to her father. “We will have to get the bride and groom a presento,” she said, </p>
<p class="calibre2">and asked if he could go with her to a store where silver pieces were sold. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr.  Drew  nodded,  even  though  Mrs.  Mise  declared  this  was  not  necessary.  The  Drews </p>
<p class="calibre2">insisted,  however,  so  she  directed  them  to  a  shop  within  walking  distance.  Before  Nancy </p>
<p class="calibre2">and  her  father  left,  Mrs.  Mise  announced  that  she  had  a  hairdresser’s  appointment  in  an </p>
<p class="calibre2">hour. </p>
<p class="calibre2">47 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I believe you would find it interesting to come along,” she said to Nancy. “The beauty salon </p>
<p class="calibre2">is in the basement of a hotel, and they specialize in getting brides ready for their weddings.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Perhaps  I  can  get  my  hair  shampooed  and  set,”  the  girl  said.  “Then  I  won’t  feel  that  I’m </p>
<p class="calibre2">being too inquisitive when I watch a bride prepare.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mrs. Mise offered to make an appointment for her and asked the Drews to please be back </p>
<p class="calibre2">within an hour. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">When  Nancy  and  her  father  reached  the  shop,  she  could  not  refrain  from  talking  to  the </p>
<p class="calibre2">manager about the strange jewel theft the night before. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“It was most unfortunate,” he commented. “We think we have very tight security, but then, </p>
<p class="calibre2">one never knows.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The Drews purchased a filigreed silver basket for the bride. The saleswoman told them such </p>
<p class="calibre2">baskets were used by Japanese families to hold tea biscuits and little cakes with fruit. Nancy </p>
<p class="calibre2">suggested to her father that they send a bud vase to the bride’s parents. Both matters were </p>
<p class="calibre2">taken  care  of,  and  the  saleswoman promised that the  gifts  would be  delivered before  the </p>
<p class="calibre2">wedding. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy and her father reached home just in time for her to go with Mrs. Mise to the beauty </p>
<p class="calibre2">parlor. On the way, the young sleuth kept looking out the rear window. She was sure that a </p>
<p class="calibre2">car was following close behind! </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I don’t want to frighten you, Mrs. Mise,” she said, “but I think the man in back of us might </p>
<p class="calibre2">try to harm us. Could you suddenly turn and lose him?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mrs. Mise was startled. Then she smiled. “I am not what you call a racing driver, but I think I </p>
<p class="calibre2">can get rid of the man.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At  the  next  comer,  she  made  a  quick  left  turn  through  a  yellow  light.  By  the  time  her </p>
<p class="calibre2">pursuer reached the intersection, the signal had changed to red, and traffic prevented him </p>
<p class="calibre2">from following. Mrs. Mise made a few more turns to throw off the man completely. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Good for you!” Nancy said. “You might take up auto racing.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mrs.  Mise  smiled  merrily.  When  they  reached  the  hotel  in  which  the  hairdresser  was </p>
<p class="calibre2">located,  a  uniformed  attendant  took  the  car,  and  Mrs.  Mise  and  Nancy  walked  into  the </p>
<p class="calibre2">lobby.  They  rode  an  elevator  to  the  beauty  salon  in  the  basement.  Mrs.  Mise  announced </p>
<p class="calibre2">herself  and  introduced  Nancy.  Both  were  shown  to  chairs.  Nancy  noticed  that  near  her  a </p>
<p class="calibre2">bride was being prepared for her wedding. The young detective marveled at the process. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">First,  the  girl’s  hair  was  tied  on  top  of  her  head  in  a  little  knot.  She  wore  a  low-cut, </p>
<p class="calibre2">sleeveless  gown,  and  the  operator  rubbed  cold  cream  all  over  her  face,  neck,  shoulders, </p>
<p class="calibre2">back  and  arms.  After  a  few  minutes,  the  cream  was  wiped  off  and  white  powder  was </p>
<p class="calibre2">48 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">dubbed generously over it with a puff. The same operation was repeated after a little while, </p>
<p class="calibre2">and  Nancy  assumed  that  the  process  would  continue  until  the  bride-to-be  had  flesh  the </p>
<p class="calibre2">color of snow. The American girl was particularly interested in the fact that the back of the </p>
<p class="calibre2">bride’s neck received special attention. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mrs. Mise, whose hair had been washed already, reached over and said, “Japanese consider </p>
<p class="calibre2">the back of the neck and upper shoulders to be more beautiful than the front of the neck </p>
<p class="calibre2">and the chest. That is why it must be pure white.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy nodded. Just then her own attendant arrived and shampooed her hair. Nancy’s hair </p>
<p class="calibre2">was already combed before the process of whitening the bride was finished. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As  the  beautician  set  Nancy’s  hair  in  loose  pin  curls,  a  dainty  batiste  slip  was  pulled </p>
<p class="calibre2">cautiously over the bride’s head and shoulders. Then she was told to lean back so that her </p>
<p class="calibre2">eyebrows could be dyed coal black. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">While  Nancy  was  left  alone  under  the  dryer,  she  could  give  the  bride  her  undivided </p>
<p class="calibre2">attention.  The  operator  put  pink  lipstick  on  the  Japanese  girl  in  three  applications.  After </p>
<p class="calibre2">each one, she brushed it daintily so that the lips finally became like a perfect rosebud. Nancy </p>
<p class="calibre2">had to admit that while the girl looked very artificial, she was startlingly beautiful. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After the make-up had been completed, the operator brought in the exquisite bridal kimono </p>
<p class="calibre2">and adjusted it properly. At that moment a messenger arrived with a large box containing </p>
<p class="calibre2">the wig and hair ornaments. It was gently lifted out and set over the bride’s hair. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The  headgear  was  a  combination  wig  and  hat  that  had  no  crown.  A  white  band  went </p>
<p class="calibre2">completely  around  it,  and  fastened  to  the  band  were  many  combs  and  pins  containing </p>
<p class="calibre2">danglers of all sorts. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Once more Mrs. Mise leaned over and explained to Nancy that these were symbols. “They </p>
<p class="calibre2">indicate a long, happy life, lovely children, and enough money to be comfortable. The white </p>
<p class="calibre2">cloth  is  called  a  tsuno-hakushi.  Translated,  that  means  a  horn-concealer.  It  serves  as </p>
<p class="calibre2">insurance to the future husband that his bride will try not to show any horns of jealousy.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy grinned  as  Mrs. Mise  got  back  under her  dryer.  It  was  not  until both had their  hair </p>
<p class="calibre2">combed out that they felt free to talk. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly Mrs. Mise said, “Nancy, didn’t you mention a Mrs. Rossmeyer from your country </p>
<p class="calibre2">who might be in Japan?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes. Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mrs. Mise replied, “I just overheard the girl at the desk say that Mrs. Rossmeyer had called </p>
<p class="calibre2">to cancel her appointment.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The information excited Nancy. “Mrs. Mise, please ask the girl if Mrs. Rossmeyer is staying </p>
<p class="calibre2">at this hotel.” </p>
<p class="calibre2">49 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The  Japanese  woman  smiled  and  went  to  the  desk.  When  she  returned,  her  answer  was, </p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes, Mrs. Rossmeyer is staying here.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I must see her at once!” Nancy exclaimed. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I will wait here while you hurry upstairs and speak to the room clerk.” Mrs. Mise said. “Find </p>
<p class="calibre2">out which room the woman is staying in.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy nodded and went up the steps to the lobby. After a short wait, she was able to get </p>
<p class="calibre2">the clerk’s attention. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I would like to call on Mrs. Rossmeyer,” Nancy said. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
