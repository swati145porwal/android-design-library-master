<h3 class="sigilNotInTOC">Mysterious Invitation </h3>

<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“OH NO!” Nancy exclaimed in dismay. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The warden stared at her. “What is wrong?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">65 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Mr. Kampura is suspected of dishonest dealings. I’m sure he forged those papers. Will you </p>
<p class="calibre2">please check them and verify the signature?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">By  now  the  warden  felt uncomfortable. “Of  course.  I  will  get  them  from my  file,”  he  said, </p>
<p class="calibre2">and  left.  A  few  minutes  later  he  returned  with  a  folder.  “The  documents  were  signed  by </p>
<p class="calibre2">Judge Hiawasa. I shall call him at once and confirm his signature.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He phoned the judge’s chambers and apparently found him in. After a brief conversation in </p>
<p class="calibre2">Japanese, the warden hung up. His face ashen white. “You were right. Judge Hiawasa never </p>
<p class="calibre2">issued an order for the release of the woman prisoner. Oh, what have I done!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“You  let  a  known  criminal  out  of  jail,”  Nancy  said.  “But  it  was  not  your  fault,”  she  added, </p>
<p class="calibre2">realizing the man’s distress. “I’m sure the forgery was an excellent one.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The warden promised to get in touch with higher authorities at once. He thanked Nancy and </p>
<p class="calibre2">Mrs. Mise for their help, and both said they were glad to have been of some service to him. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nevertheless, they  were  worried  about Mrs.  Caputti being free  and  spoke  about  it  on the </p>
<p class="calibre2">way  home.  “I  suppose  now  she’ll  join  her  husband,”  Nancy  said,  “and  perhaps  they  will </p>
<p class="calibre2">leave the country together, if he has not already gone.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">When Mrs.  Mise and  Nancy  reached home,  the girl  detective packed  her  bags.  Then  their </p>
<p class="calibre2">hosts drove the Drews to the airport and said good-by. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Be sure to let us know how you progress with the case,” Mr. Mise said. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Indeed we will,” Nancy replied. “We never can thank you enough for your help in trying to </p>
<p class="calibre2">solve this international case.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In the airport Nancy and her father looked carefully for the Caputtis. There was no sign of </p>
<p class="calibre2">them, and finally Nancy and her father boarded their plane. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">When  they  reached  River  Heights  the  next  day  and  walked  into  their  own  house,  Hannah </p>
<p class="calibre2">was overjoyed to see them. After she and Nancy exchanged hugs, Mrs. Gruen said she had </p>
<p class="calibre2">worried every minute during the Drews’ absence. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Any special reason?” Nancy’s father asked her. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The  housekeeper  said  that  several  phone  calls  had  come  for  them.  When  she  told  the </p>
<p class="calibre2">persons that the Drews were not at home, they had left various messages. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’ve written them all down for you to look at later. Some of them were warnings of one sort </p>
<p class="calibre2">or  another.  Several  of  the  callers  demanded  to  know  how  to  get  in  touch  with  you.  Of </p>
<p class="calibre2">course, I did not tell them, and while I didn’t say so, my answers inferred that you were only </p>
<p class="calibre2">out of town temporarily.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Good for you!” Mr. Drew praised her. “You probably saved us a lot of trouble.” </p>
<p class="calibre2">66 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">When Nancy walked into the dining room, she was amazed to see the table set for a number </p>
<p class="calibre2">of people. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Who’s coming?” she asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Hannah Gruen smiled. “Three guesses.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy counted the number of places, then said, “Bess, George, Ned, Burt, and Dave.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Correct.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Before  the  guests  arrived,  Nancy  unpacked  her  clothes  and  the  gifts  she  had  brought. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Hurrying  downstairs,  she  put  the  boxes  at  the  places  where  each  recipient  would  sit,  and </p>
<p class="calibre2">she attached cards. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">All the guests arrived in a little while. Bess said, “Oh, Nancy, I’m so happy you’re home safe </p>
<p class="calibre2">and sound,” and hugged her. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">George  was  eager  to  hear  about  Nancy’s  adventures.  “And  don’t  leave  out  a  word!”  she </p>
<p class="calibre2">commanded. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Burt  and  Dave,  both  strong,  sturdy  football  players,  greeted  the  Drews  enthusiastically, </p>
<p class="calibre2">saying they were envious of their exciting trip. Ned, more handsome than the others, had </p>
<p class="calibre2">brown eyes, wavy dark hair, and a ready smile. He gave Nancy an affectionate embrace. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“It’s sure great to have you back,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The  dinner  was  filled  with  fun  and  excitement,  and  the  guests  were  thrilled  with  their </p>
<p class="calibre2">presents. Hannah, Bess, and George put on their necklaces, while Ned fastened his stickpin </p>
<p class="calibre2">to his necktie. Burt and Dave were surprised to receive anything, but Nancy explained that </p>
<p class="calibre2">their gifts were actually from Bess and George, who had given her money to buy souvenirs </p>
<p class="calibre2">for their friends. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“They’re neat!” all the recipients exclaimed, and Hannah hurried to the mirror to admire her </p>
<p class="calibre2">matching necklace and earrings. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“And now tell us about your trip and what sleuthing you did in Japan,” George begged. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy and her father kept their audience spell-bound for some time. Bess actually shivered </p>
<p class="calibre2">at the episode of the man calling into her bedroom at the Mises’, and again at the frame-up </p>
<p class="calibre2">when the necklace was found in Nancy’s kimono sleeve. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m  afraid  we  didn’t  accomplish  as  much  as  we  had  hoped,”  the  young  sleuth  said.  “We </p>
<p class="calibre2">think, however, that we will be able to continue our work from here.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">67 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">When Nancy finished her account, Mr. Drew turned to Bess and George. “Suppose you tell </p>
<p class="calibre2">us what you’ve been doing during our absence.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">George  smiled.  “We  watched  Mr.  Moto’s  shop  whenever  we  could  to  see  if  Mr.  Kikichi </p>
<p class="calibre2">would do anything suspicious.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Did he?” Nancy asked eagerly. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“No. Not a thing. But one day on the way home we saw Mr. Moto in the back seat of a car. </p>
<p class="calibre2">At least we think it was Mr. Moto. He seemed to be asleep. Perhaps he was drugged.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“George,  that’s  a  wonderful  clue!”  Nancy  exclaimed.  “We  heard  it  from  the  Tokyo  police </p>
<p class="calibre2">chief but had no idea that it came from you!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“We  reported  it  to  Chief  McGinnis,”  Bess  took  up  the  story.  “He  promised  to  pass  the </p>
<p class="calibre2">information on to you.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“We tried to follow the car,” George said, “but lost it in traffic.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Did you get the license number?” Mr. Drew asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes,”  Bess  replied.  “The  police  checked  it  out  and  found  that  the  car  was  stolen.  It  was </p>
<p class="calibre2">discovered the following day in a supermarket parking lot.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Too bad,” Nancy said. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As the group at the table was eating dessert, the telephone rang. Nancy, being nearest the </p>
<p class="calibre2">hall door, jumped up and answered it. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Is this Miss Nancy Drew?” a man’s voice asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I am a friend of Mr. Moto’s. As you know, he’s planning to go to Japan. Mrs. Rossmeyer is </p>
<p class="calibre2">home now and is giving a surprise farewell party for him. She would like very much to have </p>
<p class="calibre2">you come.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Mr. Moto is still in this country?” Nancy asked, pretending to be surprised. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes. The party will be tomorrow night at her home at eight o‘clock. Please bring an escort if </p>
<p class="calibre2">you wish. When you arrive, say to the doorman, ‘Twelve and thirteen’.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy,  frowning,  walked  back  to  the  table  and  sat  down.  “I  was  just  invited  to  a  surprise </p>
<p class="calibre2">party and told to bring an escort,” she explained to her friends. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Who called?” Bess inquired. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">68 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“A friend of Mr. Moto’s!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“You’re kidding!” Ned burst out. “Did he give his name?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“No. He said the party would be held by Mrs. Rossmeyer as a send-off for Mr. Moto, who is </p>
<p class="calibre2">going to Japan.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Then Mrs. Rossmeyer is home?” Mr. Drew asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Apparently.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Hannah Gruen shook her head. “This is very strange. Mrs. Rossmeyer plans a party. There </p>
<p class="calibre2">are no formal invitations, Mr. Moto appears mysteriously at Mrs. Rossmeyer’s, and you’re </p>
<p class="calibre2">invited. She doesn’t even know you! Something’s fishy. I don’t believe you should go.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hannah is probably right,” Mr. Drew agreed. “What else did the man say, Nancy?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“That was it, except he told me to introduce myself and my escort by the numbers twelve </p>
<p class="calibre2">and thirteen.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“That does it!” Hannah cried out. “It’s a trap! Nancy, I am afraid you are in great danger if </p>
<p class="calibre2">you accept!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“But if I don’t, I might miss a wonderful chance to solve the mystery!” Nancy objected. “And </p>
<p class="calibre2">if Ned comes with me and we’re careful, I’m sure we can avoid falling into any trap. Ned, are </p>
<p class="calibre2">you game to go?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I wouldn’t miss it for the world,” he replied. He flexed the muscles in his arms. “Bring on </p>
<p class="calibre2">your crooks.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Everybody  laughed,  then  Bess  asked,  “If  Mr.  Moto  was  responsible  for  losing  Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Rossmeyer’s  valuable  necklace  with  the  thirteenth  pearl,  why  should  she  be  giving  a </p>
<p class="calibre2">farewell party for him?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Still  puzzled,  the  group  sat  around  the  table  for  a  long  while.  Then  Bess  and  George  said </p>
<p class="calibre2">they should leave. Burt and Dave went with them. After Nancy had helped Hannah tidy up, </p>
<p class="calibre2">the housekeeper and Mr. Drew said they were going to retire. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy and Ned stayed in the living room for some time discussing what they might expect at </p>
<p class="calibre2">Mrs. Rossmeyer’s party. Nancy smiled. “I suppose I’ll have to dress up.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I brought party clothes myself,” Ned announced. “One never knows what a guest of yours </p>
<p class="calibre2">may be expected to do, or where he might be asked to go, so I came prepared with all sorts </p>
<p class="calibre2">of clothes.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">69 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The house was very quiet, with Togo asleep in the kitchen. The couple sat in semidarkness. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Not  a  sound  came  from  outdoors,  until  suddenly  there  were  footsteps  and  a  commotion </p>
<p class="calibre2">near the front door. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy and Ned jumped up to see what it was. Ned took hold of Nancy’s arm. “Don’t open </p>
<p class="calibre2">the door,” he warned. “You have been in so much trouble, and this might be more of it.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A man’s voice outside shouted, “Open up or we’ll break down the door!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy  and  Ned  did  not  move.  The  warning  was  not  repeated.  Instead,  there  was  a </p>
<p class="calibre2">splintering crash, and the front door burst open. A huge vicious dog bounded inside, directly </p>
<p class="calibre2">at the couple! </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
