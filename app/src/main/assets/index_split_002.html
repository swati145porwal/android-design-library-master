<h3 class="sigilNotInTOC">Hidden Camera </h3>

<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">THE  three  girls  rejoined  Mr.  Moto,  who  had  turned  very  pale.  Nancy  was  afraid  he  might </p>
<p class="calibre2">have another attack. She suggested that he stay on the couch while the girls made a further </p>
<p class="calibre2">search for the person who had spoken. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He agreed but said he did not want to close the shop. “With these losses I cannot afford to </p>
<p class="calibre2">prevent customers from coming in,” he explained worriedly. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Bess  offered  to  work  in  the  store  for  him.  “I  would  enjoy  selling  somebody  a  diamond </p>
<p class="calibre2">engagement ring or a wedding ring,” she said, her eyes twinkling. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The jeweler smiled faintly. “Some time ago I had a special camera put in to take pictures of </p>
<p class="calibre2">anyone who seemed suspicious. This neighborhood is not as high-class as it used to be, and </p>
<p class="calibre2">sometimes I have dishonest people coming in.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He  got  up  and  showed  Bess  where  the  camera  was  located  in  a  corner  of  the  ceiling.  It </p>
<p class="calibre2">pointed directly toward the counter. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“There  is  a  button  under  the  counter,”  he  said.  “If  you  press  it,  the  camera  will  take  a </p>
<p class="calibre2">picture in stantly and develop it. See, here it is.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Bess nodded, sat down on a high stool behind the counter, and gazed at the display before </p>
<p class="calibre2">her. Mr. Moto went to lie down again, and when Bess looked at him a few minutes later, he </p>
<p class="calibre2">was sound asleep. She smiled and returned to the shop. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Meanwhile, Nancy and George had gone to hunt for the source of the voice. They could find </p>
<p class="calibre2">no shoe prints of the eavesdropper and no noticeable fingerprints. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">George  walked  up the  driveway  between Moto’s  shop  and  the next  store  and questioned </p>
<p class="calibre2">pedestrians on the street. None had seen anyone entering or leaving the alleyway. Then she </p>
<p class="calibre2">asked people if a man had lingered near the jewelry shop. In each case, the answer was no. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy  inquired  in  apartments  above  the  stores.  Most  of  the  tenants  were  apparently  out </p>
<p class="calibre2">because they did not answer their doorbells. The few who were home had seen nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">She returned to the rear of the jewelry shop. When Nancy looked up, she noticed  a young </p>
<p class="calibre2">woman leaning out of a window. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy  called  up  to  her,  “Did  you  by  any  chance  see  a  man  loitering  around  Mr.  Moto’s </p>
<p class="calibre2">place?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“When?” the woman asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2">6 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, a little while ago, about twenty minutes,” the young sleuth replied. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes. A fellow was standing by the back door. He spoke to someone inside.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“He must be the one,” Nancy said. “What did he look like?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The neighbor said she could not see him too well from upstairs. “He was rather short and </p>
<p class="calibre2">stocky, had very black hair, and wore a gray suit. I’m afraid that’s all I can tell you.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“It’s a wonderful identification.” Nancy smiled. “By the way, was he of Asiatic origin?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The woman shook her head. “I couldn’t see his face, but I don’t think he was.” She asked if </p>
<p class="calibre2">something was wrong. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy replied that the man had called into the shop, then disappeared. This answer seemed </p>
<p class="calibre2">to satisfy the woman, and Nancy was glad she did not have to go into further details. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The young sleuth now turned up the driveway and met George in the street. “Any luck?” she </p>
<p class="calibre2">asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“None,” George replied. “How about you?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy  told  her  about  the  clue  she  had  just  picked  up.  Then  the  girls  began  questioning </p>
<p class="calibre2">passers-by,  but  no  one  had  seen  the  mysterious  stranger.  The  two  sleuths  were  about  to </p>
<p class="calibre2">give up when they saw a woman with a large package walking toward a parked sedan. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">To Nancy’s inquiry, she answered, “Yes, a man fitting that description ran up the alleyway </p>
<p class="calibre2">just as I parked my car.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Did you see his face?” George inquired. “Can you tell us what nationality he was?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The woman smiled. “He appeared to be of Italian descent.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy and George were thrilled by this additional information. Now they had something to </p>
<p class="calibre2">work on! </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Did  you  see  where  the  man  went?”  George  asked  as  she  helped  the  woman  put  her </p>
<p class="calibre2">package into the car. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes. He jumped into a black sedan that somebody else was driving, and they sped off in a </p>
<p class="calibre2">hurry.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Thank you very much,” Nancy said. “We’re trying to locate this man, and your information </p>
<p class="calibre2">will help.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">7 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Before the stranger could become inquisitive, the girls turned and walked to the rear of the </p>
<p class="calibre2">shop again, letting themselves in through the back door. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Meanwhile, Bess had had an adventure of her own. A rather large, mannish-looking woman </p>
<p class="calibre2">with  an  abundance  of  blond  hair  exaggeratedly  coiffed  had  briskly  walked  into  the  store. </p>
<p class="calibre2">She  came  up  to  the  counter  and  said  in  a  harsh  voice,  “Please  give  me  Mrs.  Rossmeyer’s </p>
<p class="calibre2">address in Europe.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Bess did not like her customer. She seemed hard and cruel. “I don’t know the address,” the </p>
<p class="calibre2">girl replied. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, come now,” the woman said. “If you work here, you certainly must know what address </p>
<p class="calibre2">Mrs. Rossmeyer left with Mr. Moto. She’s in Europe somewhere. I’m a friend of hers and am </p>
<p class="calibre2">going abroad. I want to look her up.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m really sorry,” Bess replied, “but I truly don’t know it. Why don’t you come back some </p>
<p class="calibre2">other time and talk to Mr. Moto?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The stranger was annoyed. “Where is Mr. Moto? Get him. He’ll give it to me.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Bess was beginning to worry. The woman did not look or act like a nice person, and she felt </p>
<p class="calibre2">that  giving  her  any  further  information  might  not  be  in  the  best  interest  of  either  Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Rossmeyer or Mr. Moto. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">She said, “Please come back another day, perhaps tomorrow.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“But I must have the address today!” the woman insisted. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Bess was not sure she knew how to handle the situation. Finally she said, “I’ll tell Mr. Moto </p>
<p class="calibre2">you were here. What’s your name?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The stranger grew red in the face with anger. “That’s none of your business!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“She’s  not  honest,”  Bess  thought  frantically.  “She’s  trying  to  hide  something!”  With </p>
<p class="calibre2">trembling fingers, the girl reached under the counter and pushed the button that operated </p>
<p class="calibre2">the camera on the ceiling. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Trying hard to conceal her nervousness, Bess said, “If you won’t leave your name, what shall </p>
<p class="calibre2">I tell Mr. Moto?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Never mind. But you’ll be sorry for your stubbornness, you silly girl!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">With this, the woman turned and hurried out the door. For a moment, Bess stared after her, </p>
<p class="calibre2">shocked and surprised. Then she sank down on the stool, trembling. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Just  then  Nancy  and  George  returned.  Having  found  Mr.  Moto  sleeping,  they  tiptoed </p>
<p class="calibre2">through the back room into the shop. </p>
<p class="calibre2">8 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, am I ever glad to see you!” Bess said, her voice shaking. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“What’s the matter?” George asked, alarmed. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Bess  poured  out  her  story.  When  she  told  about  taking  the  woman’s  photograph,  Nancy </p>
<p class="calibre2">said, “Good for you! Maybe the police can identify this person. From what you say, I doubt </p>
<p class="calibre2">that she’s really a friend of Mrs. Rossmeyer’s.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The other girls agreed. Bess looked toward the camera. “Who’s going to climb up there and </p>
<p class="calibre2">get the picture?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">George seemed the most likely candidate. But try as she would, she was unable to reach the </p>
<p class="calibre2">camera. At this moment Mr. Moto walked into the shop. He looked refreshed, and color had </p>
<p class="calibre2">come back to his face. He gazed up at George, who was stepping on one shelf and trying to </p>
<p class="calibre2">reach another. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“What—what are you doing?” he asked in a puzzled voice. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Bess took a picture of a woman who claimed to be a friend of Mrs. Rossmeyer’s. How do </p>
<p class="calibre2">you get it?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr. Moto smiled. “I will bring a ladder.” He disappeared into the back  room and, in a few </p>
<p class="calibre2">seconds, returned with a tall, narrow ladder. It had a hook at the end that fitted over the </p>
<p class="calibre2">shelf beneath the camera. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Push that lever on the right,” he directed. “The picture will come out the front.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">George did this,  and  a photo  appeared.  She pulled  it  out,  then descended the  ladder.  She </p>
<p class="calibre2">laid the snapshot on the counter, and they all gazed at it. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“It’s an excellent likeness,” Bess remarked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr. Moto said, “I do not recognize the woman. You say that she claimed to be a friend of </p>
<p class="calibre2">Mrs. Rossmeyer’s?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes,” Bess replied, and explained what had happened. “But I don’t believe she was telling </p>
<p class="calibre2">the truth. She was horrid.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I do not like this,” Mr. Moto said, visibly disturbed. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy asked the jeweler to tell them more about Mrs. Rossmeyer. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“She is a widow,” he began, “and travels in European high society. She is not sociable with </p>
<p class="calibre2">River Heights people. She has a personal maid, an Asiatic who travels with her. When Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Rossmeyer  is  at  home,  her  maid  does  all  the  shopping,  cooking,  and  so  on.  There  are  no </p>
<p class="calibre2">other servants.” </p>
<p class="calibre2">9 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy felt that Mr. Moto considered the woman a little strange but was too polite to say so. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I have never seen Mrs. Rossmeyer,” he went on. “I only spoke to her over the telephone. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The maid brought in the necklace.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Mr. Moto, would you mind if we take this photograph to the police? It might be a clue to </p>
<p class="calibre2">the thief who took Mrs. Rossmeyer’s necklace.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr.  Moto  nodded.  “But  do  not  say  anything  about  the  stolen  strand  of  pearls.  I  am </p>
<p class="calibre2">permitting  you  to  take  this  picture  to  the  police  because  Mrs.  Rossmeyer’s  life  may  be  in </p>
<p class="calibre2">danger.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">As the girls were ready to leave, they extracted a promise from him that he would close up </p>
<p class="calibre2">his shop and go home soon. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He smiled. “You are so thoughtful. I appreciate all of this. I believe you will be able to solve </p>
<p class="calibre2">my mystery.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“We certainly hope so,” Nancy said. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At  headquarters  it  did  not  take  Chief  McGinnis  long  to  identify  the  woman  in  the </p>
<p class="calibre2">photograph. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Her  name  is  Rosina  Caputti,”  he  said,  “and  she’s  the  wife  of  an  underworld  character </p>
<p class="calibre2">known as Benny the Slippery One Caputti.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“What’s his specialty?” Nancy asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“According to the report, he’s a jewel thief.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh!” Bess burst out. It seemed as if she was about to say more, but nudges from Nancy and </p>
<p class="calibre2">George  made  her  keep  quiet.  The  three  girls  wondered  if  Caputti  and  his  wife  were </p>
<p class="calibre2">connected with World Wide Gems, Inc. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">While Chief McGinnis answered a phone call, Nancy whispered to Bess, “You did a great job </p>
<p class="calibre2">today. I think we picked up a very good clue to the mystery!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
