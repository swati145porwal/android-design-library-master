<h3 class="sigilNotInTOC">The Captive’s Story </h3>

<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">SOME time later, Nancy revived. She was lying on a hard, cold floor in total darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Relieved that she was neither bound nor gagged, she sat up. “Ned?” she called out. “Ned, </p>
<p class="calibre2">are you here?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ned tried to clear his head of the confusion resulting from his ordeal. “I’m here,” he replied. </p>
<p class="calibre2">“Where are you?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy felt in her pocket for the flashlight. Fortunately it had not been taken from her. She </p>
<p class="calibre2">played the beam around. “I think we’re in a barn,” she said, “and—” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">A  low  groan  interrupted  her.  It  came  from  a  prone  figure  lying  near  Nancy.  The  young </p>
<p class="calibre2">people rushed up to the bound and gagged victim, and Nancy shone her light on him. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Mr. Moto!” she cried out in dismay. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Quickly Nancy and Ned unbound the jeweler and removed the cloth from his mouth. “Are </p>
<p class="calibre2">you all right?” Nancy asked anxiously. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">82 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Much better now that the gag is off,” the man replied. As Nancy and Ned raised him to a </p>
<p class="calibre2">sitting position, a smile crossed his face. “Miss Drew!” he exclaimed. “How did you find me? </p>
<p class="calibre2">And who is this young man?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“This is my friend Ned Nickerson. But before we tell you anything more, we must get away </p>
<p class="calibre2">from here.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“How did you come in here?” Mr. Moto asked. “I was asleep and didn’t hear anyone enter.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“We were taken prisoners,” Nancy replied ruefully, “and gassed.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh,  dear!”  Mr.  Moto  cried  out.  “Then  we  will  not  be  able  to  leave.  The  big  doors  are </p>
<p class="calibre2">padlocked on the outside.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ned, who had gone to investigate, came to the same conclusion. “He’s right, Nancy. There’s </p>
<p class="calibre2">no way to get these open.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“We’ll  figure  out  something,”  Nancy  said,  trying  to  sound  calm.  “In  the  meantime,  Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Moto, tell us what happened to you.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I found out about the cult and the jewel thieves, so they kidnapped me. Mr. Kampura did </p>
<p class="calibre2">it. He left his sandals by mistake and was quite worried that they would be found.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“We did find them,” Nancy said. “And we suspected they belonged to him, but we couldn’t </p>
<p class="calibre2">prove it.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr.  Moto  nodded.  “In order  to  avoid  any suspicion,”  he  went on,  “they made  me  call  my </p>
<p class="calibre2">friend Mr. Kikichi and ask him to take over the store while I was supposedly in Japan.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Then Mr. Kikichi is innocent after all!” Ned exclaimed. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Of course he is,” Mr. Moto said. “Do you know if he’s all right?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes,”  Nancy  replied.  “I’m  afraid  he  was  hurt  when  your  store  was  burglarized  after  your </p>
<p class="calibre2">disappearance, but he’s fine now.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, dear, oh—” Mr. Moto clasped his hands in despair and turned white. Nancy was afraid </p>
<p class="calibre2">he might have another attack, but she and Ned managed to calm the jeweler. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Please don’t worry,” Nancy told him. “Mr. Kikichi has recovered completely, and I’m sure </p>
<p class="calibre2">we’re close to solving this mystery, and you will be able to recover your losses.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Tell us what happened to you after you were brought here,” Ned urged. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“They held me in this barn and only unbound me long enough so I could eat and  get some </p>
<p class="calibre2">exercise. When I talked to you on the telephone, Miss Drew—” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">83 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“It  was  you  who  called  and  invited  me  to  Mrs.  Rossmeyer’s  party?”  Nancy  asked,  very </p>
<p class="calibre2">surprised. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes, it was. The man who comes in here to watch me while I’m eating was called away on </p>
<p class="calibre2">an  emergency for  a few  minutes.  I  know  there  is  a  phone  in the  covered  box  over  in  that </p>
<p class="calibre2">corner, so I used it.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“That was clever and very courageous,” Nancy said admiringly. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“But why didn’t you tell Nancy you were a prisoner?” Ned inquired. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I was afraid that someone might overhear me on an extension. I am sure there are many </p>
<p class="calibre2">phones  in  the  complex  here.  That  is  why  I  disguised  my  voice  and  did  not  ask  for  help </p>
<p class="calibre2">directly or tell you to go to the police. I thought you would catch on and try to rescue me.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“But how did you know about the party?” Nancy asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I  overheard  two  men  say  they  were  using  Mrs.  Rossmeyer’s  house  for  a  big  ceremonial </p>
<p class="calibre2">celebration. They expected an honored guest whose name happens to be Moto, too. He was </p>
<p class="calibre2">on his way to Japan.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“We met him,” Nancy said. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“He is a close friend of the woman who calls herself Mrs. Rossmeyer,” Mr. Moto went on, </p>
<p class="calibre2">“and  works  as  a  liaison  between  this  country  and  Japan.  The  fake  Mrs.  Rossmeyer  is  an </p>
<p class="calibre2">expert jewel thief and organizes those who do the stealing for the Caputti gang.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Are all the cult members thieves?” Ned asked. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Not all. Only a select group. The others are dedicated pearl cultists.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“We must get out of here!” Nancy said after a moment of silence. “Can’t we break down the </p>
<p class="calibre2">door, Ned?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“That would make so much noise we’d attract their attention, and they’d come running,” he </p>
<p class="calibre2">objected. “We’ll have to think of something else.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At  this  moment  they  heard  a  loud  commotion  at  the  main  house.  Through  a  crack  in  the </p>
<p class="calibre2">door, they could see lights flashing and orders being issued. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“The police have arrived!” Nancy exclaimed, relieved. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“If you’re right,” Ned said, “then we may as well try to break down the door!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">84 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He looked around for a pole or another heavy article they could use as a battering ram. He </p>
<p class="calibre2">found several new wooden fence rails and picked one up. It was very heavy. Ned took hold </p>
<p class="calibre2">of the front end, Nancy grabbed the middle, and Mr. Moto insisted upon holding the rear. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Wham!  The  barn  doors  shivered  but  did  not  break.  The  three  retreated  a  little,  then  ran </p>
<p class="calibre2">forward into the wooden barrier again. This time there was a splintering crash. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Once more!” Ned urged. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">They went back farther, then rushed ahead and with great force, rammed the door. The lock </p>
<p class="calibre2">broke away, and the doors flew open. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The  prisoners  dashed  out.  Lights  from  cars  and  lanterns  proved  that  the  police  had </p>
<p class="calibre2">surrounded the house. Cultists in slippers and bath-robes were running from several exits, </p>
<p class="calibre2">screaming and calling on the pearl goddess. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy, Ned, and Mr. Moto hurried toward the house. The jeweler panted. “Crazy thievesl” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">They  found the  place  bustling  with police. Many  of the  cultists  had  already been  rounded </p>
<p class="calibre2">up,  including  Mr.  Kampura,  Benny  the  Slippery  One  Caputti,  and  the  “pearl  goddess.”  She </p>
<p class="calibre2">was being questioned along with the other Mr. Moto. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The  officer  in  charge  told  her  that  all  of  them  were  under  arrest,  but  the  woman  argued </p>
<p class="calibre2">violently. In an arrogant manner she kept proclaiming her innocence, insisting that the cult </p>
<p class="calibre2">was  only  interested  in  tranquility.  Suddenly  she  noticed  Mr.  Moto,  the  jeweler,  and </p>
<p class="calibre2">blanched. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">He  cried  out  angrily,  “I  accuse  you  of  kidnapping  me  and  holding  me  prisoner,  and  of </p>
<p class="calibre2">impersonating Mrs. Rossmeyer!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The woman stared at him, speechless. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy  stepped  forward.  “You  had  me  and  my  escort  locked  in  Mrs.  Rossmeyer’s  home </p>
<p class="calibre2">tonight!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Before the woman had a chance to reply, there was loud barking outside, then a policeman </p>
<p class="calibre2">came  in,  desperately  trying  to  contain  a  fierce  German  shepherd  that  bounded  up  to  Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Caputti, pulling the officer along. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s the vicious dog that almost attacked us at my home after his owner broke the door </p>
<p class="calibre2">down!”  Nancy  cried  out.  “And  you  were  the  one  who  sent  me  those  warning  notes  in </p>
<p class="calibre2">Tokyo!” She pointed at Benny the Slippery One, who glared at her in silence. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Two more prisoners were brought in, a heavy-set blond woman who struggled fiercely and a </p>
<p class="calibre2">young Japanese man. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">85 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Rosina Caputti!” Nancy exclaimed. “She managed to get out of the Tokyo prison with the </p>
<p class="calibre2">help of Mr. Kampura and a number of forged documents! And that man next to her stole  a </p>
<p class="calibre2">pearl necklace from Mr. Moto’s shop and made his getaway just when my girl friends and I </p>
<p class="calibre2">arrived.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The  officer  in  charge  looked  at  Nancy  admiringly.  “You  seem  to  know  more  about  these </p>
<p class="calibre2">people than we do. Would you be willing to testify against them?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes, indeed,” Nancy replied. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr.  Moto  spoke  up.  “While  you  are  busy  rounding  up  these  criminals,  I  would  like </p>
<p class="calibre2">permission to search this house. I am sure I can identify many stolen pieces of jewelry. From </p>
<p class="calibre2">conversations I overheard, I know where some of their hiding places are.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Go ahead,” the officer told him, and Mr. Moto, Nancy, and Ned started off. The girl sleuth </p>
<p class="calibre2">first led Mr. Moto to the room where the priceless necklace was displayed in the glass case. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Excitedly he rushed up and examined the piece. “It is the one, the very one, that was stolen </p>
<p class="calibre2">from me! The one Mrs. Rossmeyer left in my care!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr. Moto took the lid off the glass case and reached in. With almost loving hands he lifted </p>
<p class="calibre2">the necklace from the figure, gazed at it, and dropped it into his pocket. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I am so thankful to get it back,” he said, “and Nancy Drew deserves full credit for finding </p>
<p class="calibre2">this.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy blushed at the praise. “I had plenty of help—my girl friends, my father, and Ned, to </p>
<p class="calibre2">say nothing of Professor Mise and his wonderful relatives in Tokyo.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“You went to Tokyo?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes. My father and I stayed with the professor’s brother and his wife. While I was there, I </p>
<p class="calibre2">tried to find your brother, Tetsuo, because I thought he might be able to tell me where you </p>
<p class="calibre2">were. But he had moved, and none of the neighbors knew his new address.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“How did you know I had a brother? You are an incredible detective.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Mrs. Rooney, your neighbor, told me.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr. Moto smiled. “She is a nice lady. I talk to her often. And you are right. Tetsuo moved to </p>
<p class="calibre2">a small town near Kyoto. In a way, I am glad you did not find him. He knew nothing about </p>
<p class="calibre2">my  problems,  of  course,  and  if he had  any  idea of  my disappearance,  I am  sure he  would </p>
<p class="calibre2">have been very worried.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nancy nodded. “So it all turned out for the best. Now we’d better continue searching this </p>
<p class="calibre2">house.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">86 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">In their hunt, the trio found most of the pieces that had been stolen from Mr. Moto’s shop </p>
<p class="calibre2">while Nancy and her father were in Japan. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“This  proves  that  the  cultists  were  responsible  for  that  robbery,”  Nancy  said,  “and  for </p>
<p class="calibre2">harming Mr. Kikichi.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr.  Moto  pulled  open  a  secret  drawer  in  a  desk  that  he  had  heard  Kampura  mention  to </p>
<p class="calibre2">another  member  of  the  cult,  and  he  pulled  out  many  strings  of  pearls.  Each  one  had  a </p>
<p class="calibre2">thirteenth pearl in the middle! </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Look  how  beautiful  they  are!”  Mr.  Moto  said.  “All  different  hues.  I  wonder  where  these </p>
<p class="calibre2">came from?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“There  have  been  many  thefts,  especially  in  Japan,”  Nancy  said.  “I’m  sure  the  pieces  can </p>
<p class="calibre2">eventually be identified and returned to their rightful owners.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Her next find was a diamond and ruby necklace. “That’s like the one that was slipped into </p>
<p class="calibre2">my kimono sleeve to make me look like a thief!” she said. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Where did that happen?” Mr. Moto asked, taken aback. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“At a wedding in Tokyo.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The  jeweler  threw  up  his  hands.  “It  is  true  that  World  Wide  Gems  have  dishonest  people </p>
<p class="calibre2">working in every country!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m afraid so,” Nancy answered. “No doubt this will come out at the trial.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I wonder who the leader of the group is,” Nancy mused. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Mr. Kampura. I overheard someone say this. He has confederates all over the world who </p>
<p class="calibre2">are giving World Wide Gems a bad name.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“What  about  the  real  Mrs.  Rossmeyer?”  Nancy  asked.  “She’s  on  the  board  of  directors  of </p>
<p class="calibre2">that company, you know.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“I  was  not  aware  of  that.  But  I  do  know  she  is a  fine,  honest  lady.  Just before  she  left  for </p>
<p class="calibre2">Europe, Mrs. Rossmeyer had me appraise a lot of her jewelry. They are among the pieces we </p>
<p class="calibre2">found.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment Mr. Drew and Chief McGinnis walked into the room. The lawyer grabbed his </p>
<p class="calibre2">daughter affectionately. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Thank  goodness  you’re  safe!”  he  said.  Then  his  eyes  fell  on  the  jeweler.  “Mr.  Moto!”  he </p>
<p class="calibre2">exclaimed. “I’m so glad to see you. Where have you been?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">87 </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Tied up  in the  barn. Nancy  and  Ned  saved  me from  a terrible fate,” Mr.  Moto  replied.  “I </p>
<p class="calibre2">must make charges against my kidnappers  and the other jewel thieves. Will you represent </p>
<p class="calibre2">me?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The  lawyer  said  he  would  be  very  glad  to  do  so.  Together  the  men  walked  into  the  room </p>
<p class="calibre2">where the “pearl goddess” was still arguing with police about her innocence. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr. Drew said to her, “How do you explain your connection with World Wide Gems, Inc.?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">At  first  the  woman  would  not  admit  anything,  but  finally,  seeing  that  her  protests  were </p>
<p class="calibre2">useless, she broke down and told the full story. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The  heads  of  World  Wide  Gems,  Inc.  were  honest  men,  but  many of  those under  them  in </p>
<p class="calibre2">various countries were committing thefts under the supervision of Mr. Kampura. They also </p>
<p class="calibre2">employed  groups  of  thieves,  and  they  used  the  cultist  organization  to  cover  up  the </p>
<p class="calibre2">operation and their encampment as a place to hide their loot. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">After all the guilty parties had been taken away by the police, Nancy and Ned drove off in his </p>
<p class="calibre2">car to return to River Heights. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">“Nancy, you did a great job,” he praised her as he drove down the wooded lane. </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">She  merely  smiled  and  said,  “You  were  a  terrific  help,  Ned.”  She  paused  a  moment,  then </p>
<p class="calibre2">said, “Do you think we’ll ever get another mystery to solve?” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ned chuckled. “It’s just like you to say that, Nancy. It seems to me that you have had quite a </p>
<p class="calibre2">few mysteries to solve since The Secret of the Old Clock.” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Mr. Drew had offered to take Mr. Moto to his home. On the way, the Japanese jeweler said </p>
<p class="calibre2">to him, “I think you have the most wonderful daughter in the world!” </p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"></p>
